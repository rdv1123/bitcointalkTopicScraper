Nuggets is a consumer blockchain platform giving users a single biometric tool for login, payment and identity verification, without sharing or storing personal data. For too long, we have all been handing control of our sensitive private data to countless online services. Held in huge corporate silos, that data is vulnerable to breaches, hacks and abuse. Billions of records have been exposed or stolen in recent years. Make sure to read through the Whitepaper or Summary to understand how Nuggets aims to give you back control of your data.  ICO Website Telegram Group Nuggets Summary Nuggets Whitepaper  Hard Cap A total of 10 billion tokens will be issued with 1.75 billion sold in the pre-sale at a 20% discount and 1.75 billion sold in the public sale. A total of 3.5 billion tokens will be available in the Token Sale. The Token Sale will be hard capped at a total raise of approximately USD $30 million to fund the platform launch and carry Nuggets to profitability.  Token Structure An ERC20 smart contract for use as a unit of account and means of exchange between consumers and retailers on the Nuggets platform  Pricing Structure The price is $0.0069 per NUG token in the pre-sale and USD $0.0086 per NUG token in the public sale.
