Millions of traders anywhere in the world will have unlimited access to a simple and comfortable way of decentralized trading more than 100+ cryptocurrencies.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PreICO Starts: 20th June 2018 ICO : 25th July 2018 - 10th Sep 2018 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   What is UPX Tokens?  UPX Tokens are ERC20 based token that is one of the main Upfinex Exchange’s cryptocurrency with Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDT. UPX token will be easily exchanged against other cryptocurrencies. The smart contract mechanism will permit reliable trading between buyers and sellers. The Upfinex Exchange and Wallet Platforms will allow millions of traders to have unlimited access to decentralized market, providing instant payments, security and trust services that will bring new participants into a growing ecosystem.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PRE-ICO PRICE: 1 UPX = $0.20 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  How Upfinex solves the modern Exchanges problems  Upfinex is a multi-platform cryptocurrency exchange, a marketplace to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Upfinex’s goal is to provide liquidity to its own token. Token holders will be able to pay for all services of the Upfinex platform, with the spent tokens being withdrawn from circulation i.e. “burned”. This will provide an intrinsic mechanism for the increase of the token’s capitalization, as well as the ability to influence the price of the token throughout the entire period of circulation, with little regard to the behavior of traders.  Upfinex Advantages  The Upfinex Platform is able to withstand DDoS attacks of any length. It can process up to 10000 order creation requests per second, with an unlimited amount of simultaneously connected users.  The core of the platform is hidden behind the messenger interface, meaning that Upfinex maintains stability under any kind of load.  The platform has successfully passed a rigorous stress testing process for the security of the servers. Upfinex has an intuitive and easy to use interface. Users are free to choose the instant exchange of their preference to work with the exchange interface, be it IOS or Android.  We provide 24/7 technical support, responding to each customer inquiry directly through the messenger chosen by the user. A successful ICO will enable us to expand our customer support staff and add more languages, so that no clients are left without an answer, and no potential revenue is lost.  How will Upfinex guarantee token liquidity?   The UPX Digital Tokens will be accepted by Upfinex for the payment of new token listing, ICO campaign conduction, internal exchange services, and trader status acquisition.  Each Upfinex Token spent by a user will be removed from circulation, i.e. “burned”. Paying with tokens within the system will be advantageous, since the user will receive an additional 10% value to the exchange rate at that moment. The use of UPX to pay for the exchange’s services will be more beneficial than any other fiat or crypto currency.  Upfinex Exchange will focus on increasing the trade volume, price and market capitalization of its own token. For this purpose, we will increase the amount of UPX trading tools. When listing new tokens, the UPX/NewToken currency pair will benefit from preferential treatment. Considering the projected growth of trading operations, this approach guarantees the increase in demand for the UPX digital token.
