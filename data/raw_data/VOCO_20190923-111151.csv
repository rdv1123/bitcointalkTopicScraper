After the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal, centralized social media platforms have been in the hot seat with intensifying public scrutiny on how personal data is being managed and used.

The personal data of up to 87 million users, mostly in the U.S., was obtained by an analytics firm that, among its other work, helped elect President Donald Trump. In response to that revelation, lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and U.K. increased their scrutiny of the social media giant, and at least some Facebook users canceled their accounts.

In a year we gained a lot of true followers, investors and fans who believed in an idea that challenges could change the whole social base we have right now. Because we believe so much in our platform we decided to take a huge gamble and made a decision only few ICO’s have ever done — we did a huge rebrand, both in style and in our idea. We listen to our loyal community and now we are new Provoco — a challenge network were people can create or accept challenges and earn for doing so.  New website  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2y2KbfH9Og1Opc9AP6F1RA.jpeg  We have heard a lot of different opinions from our community about the style we are going for. Provoco is a social network were you accept challenges, it needs to be more adventurous and free, so we decided to make it like that — an all new design made from ground up, a design that represents our idea and represents our whole fanbase. On our new website you can see a design that is made for a variety of people — it is made for everyone, no matter the age or culture. A bit of POP, comics and pixel art represent our idea perfectly — a mash between different styles create a new way of interacting and experiencing our platform.  You can check our new website right here — http://www.provoco.me  Wallet Updates  Our new explainer video  Tokenomy — a huge change  Rebranded Whitepaper and Onepage  And much more, please read on our Medium post:  https://medium.com/@Provocome/provoco-rebrand-challenge-yourself-4f416e97df75",False
