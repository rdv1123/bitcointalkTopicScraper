Indeed, with the development of digital technologies, cryptocurrency data is now accessible everywhere: exchange platforms, social media, specialized press, dedicated TV shows, groups of influencers, word of mouth... Not a day goes by without being flooded with information! Confronted with this, each investor faces different problems: how to capture the right information at the right time among all the available data? How to understand the different emotions of the market? How to finely analyse the available information when decisions must sometimes be made in just a few minutes? Because we are aware of these challenges, our goal is clear: to design Daneel, the first AI created to help cryptocurrency investors. ▄▄▄▄▄▄  What is Daneel?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ Unlike the actual assistants (or ""chatbots"") currently available on the market, which are prone to having significant functional and technological limits, Daneel is an intelligent personal assistant based on ""Watson"", the most powerful Artificial Intelligence in the fields of Natural Language and Data and Emotional Analysis.    ▄▄▄▄▄▄  What will Daneel's features include?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ Daneel will integrate many features that will allow each investor to:  Stay informed  Interact with Daneel:  Daneel is able to understand each interaction you have with him: you just have to express a request and he will give you the most appropriate information. Thanks to the ""Machine Learning"" principle and to the number of users of the service, he is constantly learning and refining his answers!  Collect, aggregate, analyse and ensure reliability of all information:  Daneel searches, browses, collects and analyses different sources of information available from various online channels: news feeds, general media, specialized media and social networks. Once the information is collected, he sorts and categorizes all relevant data in order to only offer information that has a high level of reliability.  Analyse the emotions of the market:  Daneel is able to analyse the emotions of the market thanks to his ""Social Emotion Indicator"" feature. Through the retrieval and analysis of messages posted on social networks, Daneel can determine the prevailing feeling towards the cryptocurrency of his choice.  Define the trust rating of a cryptocurrency:  Daneel will use a specially developed algorithm to calculate, based on all the information he has gathered (currency prices, recent news social networks...), a trust rating out of 10 points. This score out of 10 will reflect the reliability of the currency at a specific time.  Access a detailed analysis report for a cryptocurrency:  Need a full report on a cryptocurrency? Daneel provides you with one up-to-date document that encompasses all the information that you need.  Manage your cryptocurrency portfolio Daneel allows you to easily manage your different trading accounts and cryptocurrency portfolios. You will be able to follow your investments in real time and to place orders by following the smart advice that Daneel provides you.  Learn An educational service particularly suited to beginners will answer various questions concerning Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, legislative aspects and more. Several concepts will be explained to the user each day, and they will be able to verify their knowledge through ""mini-tests"" in the form of multiple choice tests.  Share In addition to the help provided by Daneel, we want to integrate a ""Social Trading"" feature. Thanks to this feature, users will be able to observe and follow the investments of experienced investors. In exchange, the traders most appreciated by the community will be rewarded with DAN tokens.    ▄▄▄▄▄▄  Who are our partners?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ In order to accelerate our development and carry out our project, we have already established an international partnership agreement with IBM. Thanks to this partnership, we now have access to unrivalled expertise in Artificial Intelligence, as well as to resources that allow us to sustainably support our project. We are also in discussion with Microsoft to integrate its support program dedicated to innovative companies. Finally, we are also partners with one of the largest ecosystems of actors in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency sector: CryptoValley and Bitcoin Association of Switzerland.    ▄▄▄▄▄▄  How can users subscribe to and use Daneel?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ The Daneel service will be accessible via a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription. Only DAN tokens will allow the user to subscribe and benefit from all of Daneel’s features. These DAN tokens will be able to be acquired through:      o      Investing in the Initial Coin Offering operation coming soon      o      Buying tokens on trading platforms on which DAN will be included. ▄▄▄▄▄▄  How can you join the Daneel Community?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ You can follow us and stay informed of the latest news of Daneel’s development by subscribing on the following networks: Website: www.daneel.io ▄▄▄▄▄▄ Read our Whitepaper !",False

You perfectly described the feeling I have right now to analyse market because of the high volume of information, constantly. Especially if you follow a large number of coins.  I'm thinking about investing in the ICO as I can imagine how useful Daneel could be, even if it's only 1 year from now. However, I didn't understand one point, and I didn't find an answer in the last 8 pages.  In the WP, you state that tokens usefulness will be to pay for the subscription plan (maybe not exactly in these terms, I read the french version) in order to use Daneel, and only that. Also, you state that the subscription plan price will remain fix, even if DAN value fluctuates.  In these conditions, I don't understand why it's useful to generate DAN tokens and use a blockchain? Is it only a way to fund the project and ico sales can be seen as a bargain for early investors? And why it's useful to list DAN on exchanges, because subscription price will remain fix (in FIAT I understood), so as there is only one use for the token, why should its price move?  As I said, i'm interested in your project, but I don't get the point of an ICO.  Cordialement.",False

Indeed, with the development of digital technologies, cryptocurrency data is now accessible everywhere: exchange platforms, social media, specialized press, dedicated TV shows, groups of influencers, word of mouth... Not a day goes by without being flooded with information! Confronted with this, each investor faces different problems: how to capture the right information at the right time among all the available data? How to understand the different emotions of the market? How to finely analyse the available information when decisions must sometimes be made in just a few minutes? Because we are aware of these challenges, our goal is clear: to design Daneel, the first AI created to help cryptocurrency investors. ▄▄▄▄▄▄  What is Daneel?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ Unlike the actual assistants (or ""chatbots"") currently available on the market, which are prone to having significant functional and technological limits, Daneel is an intelligent personal assistant based on ""Watson"", the most powerful Artificial Intelligence in the fields of Natural Language and Data and Emotional Analysis.    ▄▄▄▄▄▄  What will Daneel's features include?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ Daneel will integrate many features that will allow each investor to:  Stay informed  Interact with Daneel:  Daneel is able to understand each interaction you have with him: you just have to express a request and he will give you the most appropriate information. Thanks to the ""Machine Learning"" principle and to the number of users of the service, he is constantly learning and refining his answers!  Collect, aggregate, analyse and ensure reliability of all information:  Daneel searches, browses, collects and analyses different sources of information available from various online channels: news feeds, general media, specialized media and social networks. Once the information is collected, he sorts and categorizes all relevant data in order to only offer information that has a high level of reliability.  Analyse the emotions of the market:  Daneel is able to analyse the emotions of the market thanks to his ""Social Emotion Indicator"" feature. Through the retrieval and analysis of messages posted on social networks, Daneel can determine the prevailing feeling towards the cryptocurrency of his choice.  Define the trust rating of a cryptocurrency:  Daneel will use a specially developed algorithm to calculate, based on all the information he has gathered (currency prices, recent news social networks...), a trust rating out of 10 points. This score out of 10 will reflect the reliability of the currency at a specific time.  Access a detailed analysis report for a cryptocurrency:  Need a full report on a cryptocurrency? Daneel provides you with one up-to-date document that encompasses all the information that you need.  Manage your cryptocurrency portfolio Daneel allows you to easily manage your different trading accounts and cryptocurrency portfolios. You will be able to follow your investments in real time and to place orders by following the smart advice that Daneel provides you.  Learn An educational service particularly suited to beginners will answer various questions concerning Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, legislative aspects and more. Several concepts will be explained to the user each day, and they will be able to verify their knowledge through ""mini-tests"" in the form of multiple choice tests.  Share In addition to the help provided by Daneel, we want to integrate a ""Social Trading"" feature. Thanks to this feature, users will be able to observe and follow the investments of experienced investors. In exchange, the traders most appreciated by the community will be rewarded with DAN tokens.    ▄▄▄▄▄▄  Who are our partners?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ In order to accelerate our development and carry out our project, we have already established an international partnership agreement with IBM. Thanks to this partnership, we now have access to unrivalled expertise in Artificial Intelligence, as well as to resources that allow us to sustainably support our project. We are also in discussion with Microsoft to integrate its support program dedicated to innovative companies. Finally, we are also partners with one of the largest ecosystems of actors in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency sector: CryptoValley and Bitcoin Association of Switzerland.    ▄▄▄▄▄▄  How can users subscribe to and use Daneel?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ The Daneel service will be accessible via a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription. Only DAN tokens will allow the user to subscribe and benefit from all of Daneel’s features. These DAN tokens will be able to be acquired through:      o      Investing in the Initial Coin Offering operation coming soon      o      Buying tokens on trading platforms on which DAN will be included. ▄▄▄▄▄▄  How can you join the Daneel Community?  ▄▄▄▄▄▄ You can follow us and stay informed of the latest news of Daneel’s development by subscribing on the following networks: Website: www.daneel.io ▄▄▄▄▄▄ Read our Whitepaper ! ▄▄▄▄▄▄ WHITEPAPER [ENG] : https://daneel.io/whitepaper WHITEPAPER [FR] : https://daneel.io/whitepaper/fr/  Social networks: Twitter: www.twitter.com/daneelproject Facebook: www.facebook.com/daneelproject LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/11348931/ Telegram: t.me/projectdaneel",False
