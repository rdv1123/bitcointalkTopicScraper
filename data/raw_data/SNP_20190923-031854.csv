During this two weeks period we have made important progress on the development of our business and we now want to share this progress with you.  The first announcement we'd like to make is our collaboration with a very important and renowned firm in the Blockchain space, Block Forward.  They are a Consultancy company whose members have over 40 years experience in business and over 20 years experience as Business Consultants and have been working hard with us to elaborate our go to market strategy and make Snapup not just a successful Tokensale, but a great Business overall. http://www.blockforward.com/  Peter Brady, its CEO, jumped on board with us and took the project at heart and has been helping our Team with our go to market strategy.    We are making great progress in this aspect and we believe that our synergy will help this business reach unprecedented heights.  The next announcement we want to make is about how we will move forward.  The first step is going to be the launch of Snapup Beta.    A limited amount of people will be able to join the platform with precedence given to our current Tokenholders, that are all invited to join and that will be able to spend their tokens on actual Snapups.  Snapup Beta is going to be a fully working MVP, and we are preparing our infrastructure to handle the delivery of the goods to your doorsteps, as well as making sure that everything runs smoothly in the participation process in order to grant you guys the best experience possible for this early development stage we are in.  Your contribution and participation to the beta program will help us bring this project to life, so we want thank in advance all the people who decide to take a chance at getting a great deal on our platform.  In the next couple of days and weeks, we will follow up with detailed instruction on how to join the Beta platform, how to prepare your tokens to be used on the platform as well as the official launch dates for the Beta, that we have anticipated compared to the current roadmap.

But I am not 100% sure, whether I have really understood your concept. With the hidden biddings on a specific product you actually allow a manufacture of goods/services to define the ""real"" market value of a specific good. What happens, if the price is so low, that potential margin is not paying off production costs?  In the current market structures all the ""middle man"" contributing with their marketing efforts. Yes your approach leaves obviously those behind and and you as manufacture saves money by avoiding margin loses (disruptive industry). And those margin ""loses"" occur today, as you need to pay all the middle man (Manufacture to wholeseller, wholeseller to retailer retailer to endcustomer). But this you can have already through a simple online shop.  So what is actually the advantage for manufactures? The advantages for end-user is probably clear, as it provides the promise to get goods for a cheaper price. But the user story for manufactures is not really clear to me.

Each action you take on the platform is awarded karma points.  There are 5 expense groups, 10% 12% 15% 17% 20%  The extraction of the assignee takes place in 2 steps.  The first step creates an array of potential winners via a fibonacci sequence from the various expense groups:  1 Person is extracted from the 10% expense group (1st group)  2 Persons are extracted from the 2nd expense group  3 Persons are extracted from the 3rd  5 Persons are extracted from the 4th  8 Persons are extracted from the fifth group  So at the end we will have an array of 19 potential winners for the event, from the 300 event pool.  This extraction takes into account the karma points. We have an algorithm that makes sure that the users with the most karma enter the array of potential assignees, but leaving a chance also to people who just joined.  Then the PIN extraction takes place  Each user that joins the event is asked to create a 3 digit pin  The array of 19 potential winners is populated in a hierarchical way The first to enter it are the users who belong to the fifth expense group(20%)  And their pin determines their position in the array, so the first who enter it, get to chose. The further take what's left.  The assignee will be the user that occupies the position correspondent to the ninetieth modulus of the summatory of the pins of the participants.  This allows the draw to be user determined, based on external and non manipulable events, and therefore, impartial. Even a 1 unit change in the pin of a single participant can result in an entirely different assignee.  The Karma system allows an healthy turnover in the extraction, since the user karma gets accumulated since one wins an event. When this happens, their karma is reset to 0  Hope this clarifies  ",False

This is a great question and I will be very glad to answer it. In each european state, the revenue for lotteries, games of chance, casinos and betting that grant a minimum chance of winning(we are talking as low as 0,00000001) was, in 2016(per state) of approximately 90 Billion Euros . Our Mechanism, even not configuring itself as a lottery, targets people who are prone to risk. I take italy for an example because it was one of the most prominent results in our market studies. Italy has a population of 60 millions people, of which, 30 millions are assiduous gamblers and spend over a year from 1500€ to 5500€ pro capite in the kinds of games described above. We’ve accurately selected our target audience and the estimates you find on the whitepaper are a result of a study that starts in 2012. The sustainability of our business model lies its foundation in these 3 facts: 1 - As the saying goes, and as our studies have shown, Everybody loves a bargain 2 - There is a large percentage of risk takers in the population of each state in which snapup wishes to operate 3 - Our mechanism is calibrated to allow an healthy turnover and keep the interest high both for the ones who are, and for the ones who are not yet winning the auctions.  Furthermore, our business model and our margins allow us to distribute incentives among participants. This, combined with the current state of our competitors, and the technological advances we want to bring in the market, makes us very confident on the power of our value proposition",False

And by doing so cryptocurrencies will become mainstream as well. My only concern is, for example I have dogecoin, and I want to buy a product using snapup with my dogecoin.

I am Alex, CEO @ Snapup  In the next couple of days we are going to release a lot of content and material to further explain the platform because we've seen that people tend to get confused over what snapup is and isn't I understand that the concept is fairly new, so let's reiterate on the Value Proposition:  Snapup is a platform to shop for premium products that offers an auction-like experience; But unlike traditional auctions, where the assignee is always the highest bidder, on Snapup the assignee is determined by our meritocracy based rewarding algorithm, The more active you are on the platform, and the higher you bid, the bigger your chances are to be the assignee for that auction. The bid is comprised between 10% and 20% of the Retail price of the product, and for each event there’s a maximum of 300 participants on average.  Our mechanism is able to estimate the amount of ""desire"" or ""will"" of a customer to obtain the product, via a point assignation algorithm.  Every action the users do on our platform is awarded KARMA points. Some examples might be:  1 - Joining a Snapup: Joining a Snapup is awarded the most karma points because in doing that, you are helping other obtain huge discounts on the products, while of course, trying to get the benefit for yourself  2 - Inviting a friend to join Speading the word is rewarded  3 - Buying Snapcoin The more people buy Snapcoin, the more the value of Snapcoin raises, and the more Snapups our customers can join with their current amount of Snapcoin, since the price to join a Snapup is calculated on the EURO counterpart of the Snapcoin, at the current Exchange rate.  HOW DO WE BUY THE PRODUCTS?  There is no retailer offering us discounts. Snapups are like payed auctions. You pay an amount of Snapcoin to join a Snapup. Snapcoin will also be immediately listed on all the major exchanges at the end of our ICO.  The revenue derived by the Snapcoins sold by Snapup both to investors on exchnges, and to customers on our platform, is used to purchase the products in FIAT currency for Snapup's Assignee.  Snapup is a Sharing Economy platform. This economic model allows people to make the most out of their money. Share their wealth in a mutually beneficial and meritocratic way.  Our mechanism is finely tuned to allow an healthy turnover in the victories, rewarding the ones who are most active but also leaving good chances for people that just joined. This mechanism is unique and we are waiting for patent approval over it.  COMPETITORS:  Alibaba and Amazon offer completely different services from Snapup. They are Online Retail Stores; Snapup is not set to compete with them. In fact, Amazon will be one of our main Retailers.  SHIPMENT  Snapup doesn't hold a warehouse. We are a DropShipping Company. Our partner retailers will handle the shipment of the products.  If none of our retailers is able to reach the Assignee, the order will be handled by our order-matching system that crawls the web for the nearest, top-rated retailer able to ship the product to the Assignee.  IS SNAPUP LAUNCHING WORLDWIDE?  Snapup has no country barriers. Our mechanism is created to work worldwide from day 1. There are no custom fees to be payed, since the products are shipped to the assignees from their LOCAL RETAILERS.  If the assignee resides in China, our order-matching algorithm finds a Chinese retailer that ships that particular product, and places the order, with the credit card details of Snapup, and the Shipping Address of the Assignee.  We only place orders to TOP Retailres. If we don't find a retailer in the specific country, we look for nearby retailers.  EG. If a customer resides in Cyprus, we are going to ship from Greece or from Italy.  Of course we will allow ourselves the time to perfect this mechanism, officially launching in Europe first. Operating in a country means we are actively seeking customers in that country, but if someone from outside of our official operating zome hears about Snapup and wants to join, he can do it.

Our algorithm is carefully calibrated to: • Reward the participants with the most Karma Points, but not so much that they are the only ones who have a chance to win. • Reward the participants who are willing to pay more for the product while still leaving good chances for people who are willing to pay less. • Ensure that virtually everybody will get the reward after a few interactions, because users keep collecting Karma Points proportionally as long as they don’t win a Snap. When they do win, their counter is set back to zero    When there's gonna be  300 participants in one auction, and one of them will get their product.  Does that mean, that in avarage you have to take part in 300 auctions, to finally get a product? But the more active you are, the more karma points you get, which increases the probability, but that is also the same for all the other users... So to participate in the draw you have to put in 1€ worth of snapcoins, x300.   So what is the probability of getting a win going to be in real life?

So for an Iphone that costs say 1000€, if we say Snapcoin has a market price of 0,33€, you would need 3030 SNP in total to CLOSE THE EVENT, and if we set the max participants to the event to be 300 people, everyone would have to pay approximately 10SNP to join(3,30€)  Now, say that the value of snapcoin doubles. Since the participation cost is calculated as the EURO counterpart, with your snapcoin now you can join DOUBLE the amount of Snapups.  And how would the value of Snapcoin increase over time? There's generally 2 factors that influence the value of a cryptocurrency:  1 - Supply/Demand 2 - Market Cap 3 - It's Market  Let's start with the market:  Snapcoin have value because there's someone, Snapup, who will provide a service in exchange for Snapcoin. If we buy Snapcoin back from the users(as we do) to close the events and assign the products, the value of Snapcoin can never go below what we as a company are willing to buy it back for.  Supply and demand: Snapcoin is in limited supply. The more people would want to buy Snapcoin, the more their value is going to raise.  Market Cap: The more people buy Snapcoin, the more the market cap is going to increase. Being the supply a constant that can never increase, the value of Snapcoin can't help but go up the more people buy and sell them back to us in exchange for our services and we sell them back to new or recurring customers that put more money in the system! (Can you actually visualize it?)  Now, you can clearly see how this benefits you as an investor.  We will list Snapcoin on all the major exchanges to be traded on.  Furthermore, Since we will always be the largest Snapcoin buyers and sellers, we are planning to give investors the possibility to put their snapcoin up for sale in an ""Investor Pool"". Kinda like an ""in app"" Exchange; And grant them that 15% of the snapcoin sold daily will be taken by that pool.  We've blogged about this on medium also, check this out: https://medium.com/@Snapup/how-snapup-will-change-the-way-you-shop-online-forever-7a1e29c66d35  Hope this answers your question  - Alex, CEO @ Snapup ltd",False

Or better yet, if you know the app, wunderpool where you ask people who are going in the same direction just as you are. Instead of riding a passenger car or train you have just one car where people will be dropped off as they arrive in their each destination but in the same direction. It's like that. But it's applied in retail. Imagine you could save a lot of money and really just buy whatever you need and nothing more and nothing less.  I think in the good hands.

My name is Alex and I am the CEO @ Snapup  Our mechanism is completely different from an auction website.  Snapup is a platform to complete shared purchases that allows people to “smart share” their money, and gain huge benefits in the process. It is based on a new economic model aimed to multiply by orders of magnitude the spending power of all the people who belong to the community.  Unlike traditional auctions, that sell the item to the highest bidder, and have a cumulative bidding process in which to obtain the product you have to outbid the previous bidder, in a Snap each bid is private to the bidder, and it represents the quantity of “desire” or “will” of the bidder to obtain the product.  The amount of your “bid” represents how much you desire that product, and will be taken into account in deciding the assignee, or the “winner”, for that event, but will not be the only determining factor.  Q: How do you determine the assignee for a Snap? A: With our Meritocracy Based Rewarding Algorithm Every action you perform on our platform, like inviting a friend to join, sharing your experience or other’s on your social media, buying Snapcoins and so on…is awarded KARMA POINTS. The action that awards the most points is the participation to events, because in doing so, you are helping other people save on the product they desire, while of course trying to take the benefits for yourself.  The reward in Karma Points augments proportionally to the number of Snaps you joined but didn’t win. Long story short: The more you are an active user on the platform, and the closer to 20% of the retail price of the product you are willing to pay, the higher your chances are to be the assignee for that Snap.  Hope this reply answers your question  ",False

TOKENHOLDERS BETA APPLICATION PROGRAM STARTED   This is officially the beginning of the applications for the BETA PROGRAM.    There will be a limited number of participants, with precedence given to the current TOKENHOLDERS.  If you have joined the PRESALE and would like to be among the first to use the REAL application, help us further enhance the current user experience and play a key role in the birth of the Online Shopping Revolution, please fill out the form you find at the following url: https://goo.gl/forms/wK4bznuUeB8bXb1f2  Great news are coming in the next couple of days, reserved to all the BETA Program participants.  Thank you very much for your support from all of us at Snapup    SNAPUP FAQ Snapup is a platform to shop for premium products that offers an auction-like experience; But unlike traditional auctions, where the assignee is always the highest bidder, on Snapup the assignee is determined by our meritocracy based rewarding algorithm, The more active you are on the platform, and the higher you bid, the bigger your chances are to be the assignee for that auction. The bid is comprised between 10% and 20% of the Retail price of the product, and for each event there’s a maximum of 300 participants on average.  Our mechanism is able to estimate the amount of ""desire"" or ""will"" of a customer to obtain the product, via a point assignation algorithm.  Every action the users do on our platform is awarded KARMA points. Some examples might be: 1 - Joining a Snapup: Joining a Snapup is awarded the most karma points because in doing that, you are helping other obtain huge discounts on the products, while of course, trying to get the benefit for yourself  2 - Inviting a friend to join Speading the word is rewarded  3 - Buying Snapcoin The more people buy Snapcoin, the more the value of Snapcoin raises, and the more Snapups our customers can join with their current amount of Snapcoin, since the price to join a Snapup is calculated on the EURO counterpart of the Snapcoin, at the current Exchange rate.  HOW DO WE BUY THE PRODUCTS?  There is no retailer offering us discounts. Snapups are like payed auctions. You pay an amount of Snapcoin to join a Snapup. Snapcoin will also be immediately listed on all the major exchanges at the end of our ICO.  The revenue derived by the Snapcoins sold by Snapup both to investors on exchnges, and to customers on our platform, is used to purchase the products in FIAT currency for Snapup's Assignee.  Snapup is a Sharing Economy platform. This economic model allows people to make the most out of their money. Share their wealth in a mutually beneficial and meritocratic way.  Our mechanism is finely tuned to allow an healthy turnover in the victories, rewarding the ones who are most active but also leaving good chances for people that just joined. This mechanism is unique and we are waiting for patent approval over it.  COMPETITORS:  Alibaba and Amazon offer completely different services from Snapup. They are Online Retail Stores; Snapup is not set to compete with them. In fact, Amazon will be one of our main Retailers.  SHIPMENT  Snapup doesn't hold a warehouse. We are a DropShipping Company. Our partner retailers will handle the shipment of the products.  If none of our retailers is able to reach the Assignee, the order will be handled by our order-matching system that crawls the web for the nearest, top-rated retailer able to ship the product to the Assignee.  IS SNAPUP LAUNCHING WORLDWIDE?  Snapup has no country barriers. Our mechanism is created to work worldwide from day 1. There are no custom fees to be payed, since the products are shipped to the assignees from their LOCAL RETAILERS.  If the assignee resides in China, our order-matching algorithm finds a Chinese retailer that ships that particular product, and places the order, with the credit card details of Snapup, and the Shipping Address of the Assignee.  We only place orders to TOP Retailres. If we don't find a retailer in the specific country, we look for nearby retailers.  EG. If a customer resides in Cyprus, we are going to ship from Greece or from Italy.  Of course we will allow ourselves the time to perfect this mechanism, officially launching in Europe first. Operating in a country means we are actively seeking customers in that country, but if someone from outside of our official operating zome hears about Snapup and wants to join, he can do it. And when he happens to be the assignee of an event, we will ship the product to him, just like all the other customers.  INVESTMENT  We are receiving the attention of big institutional investors that are most likely going to join our presale. On that matter, we want to tell everybody that no special treatment will be reserved to anyone. Tokensale will start on Monday August 28th at 12:30 UTC +00 We are doing this in order to allow everyone the opportunity to join our presale and benefit for the 20% bonus on our tokens.  In the next days we are going to release many videologs and news, and also the Open Sourced version of our Crowdsale Metrics System on GitHub.
