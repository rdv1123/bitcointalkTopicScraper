But no one keeps in mind that the kids today are totally different to kids 50 years ago or even 20. They have a total different mental access to education. The kids in the past have been proud, that they can learn something and get to university. Today the kids are not mature enough with 14 years to learn about physics, math, history etc. But its not even necessary to learn those things with an age of 14. But the traditional education system says that they should learn this.  In my opinion it would be much more help full to learn kids from 12 to 18 how to cook, how to bake, how to grow vegetable, how to produce self made products like juices, marmalade or honey. Or cloths. Give them an education about food, what things are healthy and what stuff should be avoided. (like nearly 70% of the stuff that can be bought in a supermarket?)

Global knowledge will most likely be improved by your Mindlink system, since this decentralization is likely to generate yet unseen synergies.",False

Thanks for all the opinions provided!  For the questions you have posted here:  How to participate in ICO and which payments methods are accepted? To learn details about participation, please follow this link to find our guide - http://mindlink.co/guide  Information about PreSale? PreSale was launched on 16th February 2018, and will last until 23th February 2018, 18:00 CET Main Sale starts right after PreSale  Are we going to partner with existing educational institutions? Yes, we certainly are! It would be a mistake to miss such an opportunity. Instead of building user and knowledge databases from scratch, we have a mutually beneficial offer for such institutions on our minds  Have we already partnered with colleges/universities? Although it is too early to tell definitely at this stage, this process is set into motion, we already have some small victories on this field. It is a constant ongoing process, most of partnerships will be formed closer to Q3-Q4 of 2018  How are we different from competitors on the market? Coursera focuses only on classical training, which is obsolete. Their main focus is cooperation with big universities. BitDegree is mainly student-oriented platform with material and courses repository presented by BitDegree. Mostly, it offers a ""one-way"" interaction, from Platform-to-student. There are a lot of people who are ready to share their skills with others, they do not take their interests into account. Our project provides an opportunity for all kinds of people to work together, for example: you excel in coding, but you are capable of teaching only in your native language. Within our ecosystem you would be able to immediately find editors and translators who will make your knowledge accessible to people from all locations of the world. Find people with similar interests, find people with whom you can better transfer your skills - this is just a little bit that our project provides. Cooperation with universities and other partnering programs - it is great, and it has to be considered, but the ability of comprehensive interaction for anyone involved is a must. Established process of knowledge sharing of ANY kind is what we strive to achieve. So - while the ideas are similar, they differ in target audience and potential uses, a lot of differences in our approaches. MindLink represents any kind of knowledge exchange between any parties, with all of the possible ways of student-mentor-universities-institutions interaction. For common people it would be just a platform to utilize their skills/to obtain new ones. Partners and universities will have their own solution designed by our team, based on MindLink platform.  RoadMap? Our RoadMap is presented on our site: http://mindlink.co/ And it also can be found in our WhitePaper: http://mindlink.co/whitepaper Happy to mention that by following the link you would find our WhitePaper in several different languages - and more language updates are in the progress",False

I do question why so few tokens are going to be issued: 20 700 000 Don't you fear this could be a barrier to entry to most people given the purchase price for each token? I don't want to play the devil's advocate here, but it seems like the success for this project will come through mass adoption.  Regarding the issue you are trying to solve, I could not agree with you more. Traditional education is failing our youth, it is so disconnected from the real world, and focuses on teaching our kids the skills needed in the job market today, instead of anticipating what skills will be needed 5-10 years from now. We are training millions of kids on stuff AI and robots will be able to do for cheaper in a few years.  With e-learning, and the focus on tomorrow technology, I can see why MindLink who appeal to people.",False

Can we change things here where remote learning becomes a possibility?

Knowledge and education is not a once off endeavor, but is something that should be pursued daily to help elevate our own levels of understanding and to create better understanding of others. Having access to an e-learning platform will place each person's educational upgrades of mind in their own hands and will create easy access to those who need it most.

First 1000 participants are eligible for the reward. 200 ML Tokens per participant. For the AirDrop we've decided to use tokens, that were initially allocated to developers. http://i68.tinypic.com/2iw5z4z.png https://i.imgur.com/Rudo9qU.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/yT2LxWk.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/E0tFome.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/dz6RXz7.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/gF6PQ3g.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/Vhf8exo.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/9uyIbsg.jpg https://i.imgur.com/V11NVua.jpg https://i.imgur.com/Koluhap.jpg To solve problems existing in traditional education, MindLink offers a convenient application that will serve as a superstructure for the standard educational process and includes additional conveniences that students can use throughout the world: a new generation video connection including private and group communication capabilities, and also the ability to stream conferences and seminars, with the possibility of recording and distributing. We create an environment where a feedback is constantly generated to react quickly on necessary changes and to fill the room of improvement. The environment, where implementation of Blockchain and smart-contracts provides whole community with the ability to interact with each other on a trust basis. This eliminates all doubts about the authenticity of knowledge or certificates granted. The handy software will attract more students who are still forced to use applications which were not designed specifically for learning purposes.  Answer to specific questions are searched all around the Internet, which often requires huge time resources and even then it is a struggle to find the most appropriate courses or information. Issue of trustworthiness is solved due to blockchain, no more fake ratings and feedbacks, no more experts’ impostors. Our solution saves time and money for those interested, while it provides students with appropriate set of trainings and teachers get to choose their own way and methods of sharing knowledge. Enterprises and corporations are able to utilize our solution to simplify recruiting process. Education portals are provided with tools to expand their user count. The ability to configure and design your own courses, using dedicated interactive tools is a game changer. Career guidance based on machine learning will never leave someone dissatisfied with the experience gained in using the application. Content-makers gain the ability to protect their intellectual property as well as effectively monetize it. Methods of payment will be transparent and most convenient for all parties. Employers will significantly reduce hiring costs and a large number of mistakes in hiring, due to an improved interaction platform, reducing the number of deceptions to almost zero and providing the ability of businesses to present courses that will be directed at training specialists with the most useful and practical skill-sets. https://i.imgur.com/Z0Fwx2K.jpg UI: User interface Necessary tools to create the very own learning plan would be provided to all users, regardless the way of studying: video-trainings, reading materials, online interactions or live discussions. There would be implemented the possibility to hold an online-conference for group studying. Each participant of our ecosystem, that wants to offer his knowledge to others, could compile own structure of a course in a convenient and acceptable form using the online course designer. Additional emphasis is put on providing simple and intuitively understandable user interface, suitable for both an advanced and inexperience users. Participants: Regardless of field of knowledge, anyone could become a participant of MindLink system. One of the main criteria of the global knowledge system is accessibility. That need brings additional demand for materials organization and their further distribution. This opens the possibility of participation in the process for editors, translators, copywriters, etc. No restrictions on the content of courses and materials are imposed, as long as they do not violate laws, and do not contain calls for violence, racism or extremism. Monetization: All users would be provided with ability to set price for their service, there would be no restrictions regarding course price. The only requirement to be followed is to maintain all the transactions within MindLink structure. Preferable way to make transactions is to proceed with them via MLToken, as the solution to manage token in a similar manner with fiat currencies would be developed precisely. Meanwhile, MLToken payments would not be mandatory, but bonuses would apply to the ones using token as payment source. Knowledge Database: Initial content filling would be provided by the time of the product launch. Content would be created by working closely with engaged partners and further cooperation with them. As a partner, legal bodies such as universities or educational portals would help us by digitalizing the information they keep and sharing it in our data storage; however any individual could also participate in this process. For the purpose mentioned above, in-app thematic portals would be created to afford universities and other important partners share the data they have. In addition to cooperating with our partners, the constant process of renewing and updating our database from open sources would be established. Certifications: Identity-verification: Ability to verify identities of the issuer and certificate holder; Certificates tracking: Ability to verify the release process of certificates; Security: Digital signatures, special prints; Anti-forgery mechanisms Intellectual property management: Intellectual property tracking has always been an expensive process. Due to high costs copyright protection is maintained only with the help of third parties involved – specialized structures and organizations. With implementation of blockchain technology even independent self-publishers are able to protect and to track all of the usage of any specific resource and publications. By using smart-contracts an authorized use of someone’s intellectual property for a certain reward becomes possible. Smart contracts utilization: Smart-contract might be a lot more complex than a simple agreement. It could provide a great range of opportunities to our partners (Universities, Educational portals) and simple teachers. Simple use cases: -   Students’ courses might be paid by a recruiting company, only if student passes the certification successfully, or if he achieves more than certain amount of points; -   Each course that was finished successfully grants student a discount for consequent courses. Main features: 1. Blockchain implemenation.     1.1 Smart-contracts as an option for recruiting companies     1.2 Intellectual property protection management     1.3 Certification. 2. Intuitive user interface 3. Designer tool - unique architecture for creating trainings by compiling in-app design tools 4. No subject restrictions, the only one is user imagination 5. Live interaction with teacher/mentor; group/conference e-learning 6.Easy start. Allows to jump from registration to learning in just minutes",False

Their main focus is cooperation with universities. There are a lot of people who are ready to share their skills with others, they do not take their interests into account. Our project provides an opportunity for all kinds of people to work together, for example: you excel in coding, but you are capable of teaching only in your native language. Within our ecosystem you would be able to immediately find editors and translators who will make your knowledge accessible to people from all locations of the world. Find people with similar interests, find people with whom you can better transfer your skills - this is just a little bit that our project provides. Cooperation with universities and other partnering programs - it is great, and it has to be considered, but the ability of comprehensive interaction for anyone involved is a must. Established process of knowledge sharing of ANY kind is what we strive to achieve.  Concerning other projects: We could've payed for everything - articles, opinions of other people, insanely well designed site and White Paper. But should it be the main priority? We do have quite a lot of private investors. The essence of ICO for us is to understand whether our project is relevant for people and whether they really need it. It would be much easier to make another fork of Bitcoin or Litecoin and go straight to the exchanges to get money. What we've chosen is much more difficult to implement, but it is much more necessary in our everyday life. It could result in a better future for all of us.

We create an environment where a feedback is constantly generated to react quickly on necessary changes and to fill the room of improvement. The environment, where implementation of Blockchain and smart-contracts provides whole community with the ability to interact with each other on a trust basis. This eliminates all doubts about the authenticity of knowledge or certificates granted. The handy software will attract more students who are still forced to use applications which were not designed specifically for learning purposes.  Answer to specific questions are searched all around the Internet, which often requires huge time resources and even then it is a struggle to find the most appropriate courses or information. Issue of trustworthiness is solved due to blockchain, no more fake ratings and feedbacks, no more experts’ impostors. Our solution saves time and money for those interested, while it provides students with appropriate set of trainings and teachers get to choose their own way and methods of sharing knowledge. Enterprises and corporations are able to utilize our solution to simplify recruiting process. Education portals are provided with tools to expand their user count. The ability to configure and design your own courses, using dedicated interactive tools is a game changer. Career guidance based on machine learning will never leave someone dissatisfied with the experience gained in using the application. Content-makers gain the ability to protect their intellectual property as well as effectively monetize it. Methods of payment will be transparent and most convenient for all parties. Employers will significantly reduce hiring costs and a large number of mistakes in hiring, due to an improved interaction platform, reducing the number of deceptions to almost zero and providing the ability of businesses to present courses that will be directed at training specialists with the most useful and practical skill-sets. UI: User interface Necessary tools to create the very own learning plan would be provided to all users, regardless the way of studying: video-trainings, reading materials, online interactions or live discussions. There would be implemented the possibility to hold an online-conference for group studying. Each participant of our ecosystem, that wants to offer his knowledge to others, could compile own structure of a course in a convenient and acceptable form using the online course designer. Additional emphasis is put on providing simple and intuitively understandable user interface, suitable for both an advanced and inexperience users. Participants: Regardless of field of knowledge, anyone could become a participant of MindLink system. One of the main criteria of the global knowledge system is accessibility. That need brings additional demand for materials organization and their further distribution. This opens the possibility of participation in the process for editors, translators, copywriters, etc. No restrictions on the content of courses and materials are imposed, as long as they do not violate laws, and do not contain calls for violence, racism or extremism. Monetization: All users would be provided with ability to set price for their service, there would be no restrictions regarding course price. The only requirement to be followed is to maintain all the transactions within MindLink structure. Preferable way to make transactions is to proceed with them via MLToken, as the solution to manage token in a similar manner with fiat currencies would be developed precisely. Meanwhile, MLToken payments would not be mandatory, but bonuses would apply to the ones using token as payment source. Knowledge Database: Initial content filling would be provided by the time of the product launch. Content would be created by working closely with engaged partners and further cooperation with them. As a partner, legal bodies such as universities or educational portals would help us by digitalizing the information they keep and sharing it in our data storage; however any individual could also participate in this process. For the purpose mentioned above, in-app thematic portals would be created to afford universities and other important partners share the data they have. In addition to cooperating with our partners, the constant process of renewing and updating our database from open sources would be established. Certifications: Identity-verification: Ability to verify identities of the issuer and certificate holder; Certificates tracking: Ability to verify the release process of certificates; Security: Digital signatures, special prints; Anti-forgery mechanisms Intellectual property management: Intellectual property tracking has always been an expensive process. Due to high costs copyright protection is maintained only with the help of third parties involved – specialized structures and organizations. With implementation of blockchain technology even independent self-publishers are able to protect and to track all of the usage of any specific resource and publications. By using smart-contracts an authorized use of someone’s intellectual property for a certain reward becomes possible. Smart contracts utilization: Smart-contract might be a lot more complex than a simple agreement. It could provide a great range of opportunities to our partners (Universities, Educational portals) and simple teachers. Simple use cases: -   Students’ courses might be paid by a recruiting company, only if student passes the certification successfully, or if he achieves more than certain amount of points; -   Each course that was finished successfully grants student a discount for consequent courses. Main features: 1. Blockchain implemenation.     1.1 Smart-contracts as an option for recruiting companies     1.2 Intellectual property protection management     1.3 Certification. 2. Intuitive user interface 3. Designer tool - unique architecture for creating trainings by compiling in-app design tools 4. No subject restrictions, the only one is user imagination 5. Live interaction with teacher/mentor; group/conference e-learning 6.Easy start. Allows to jump from registration to learning in just minutes",False
