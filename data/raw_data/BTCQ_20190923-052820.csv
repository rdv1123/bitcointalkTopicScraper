On another note, I'd like to point out to anyone interested / on the fence as far as joining and further supporting this project goes; The Development team is without a doubt a top notch assembly of individuals and its fairly evident that they have nothing but the best interests of this coin at heart. I personally have extremely high hopes for this project and look forward to seeing it progress as time goes on. I think it's also good to note that while the transaction speeds are vastly increased in comparison to the original Bitcoin, the roadmap itself also lends a hand as far as where this coin may stand out from other ERC20 tokens.
