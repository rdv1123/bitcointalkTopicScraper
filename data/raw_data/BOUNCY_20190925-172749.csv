In short, government-approved lotteries provide fewer payments than the way traditional masses run lotteries back in the 1950s and 1960s. The modern lottery is more like a carrot with a stick installment scheme, than a legitimate way to be entertained by playing a game of chance; and, like all other things involving politicians, the modern lottery is broken and resembles nothing more than cash for the budget of the state government that is bound. What we have today is a bankrupt government running a lottery that benefits them to take advantage of the widely known problem of public health gambling, which mostly affects the poorest of us.

The duality of this may impact both sides; first, gambling may improve in terms of accessibility, and the other, may ignite gambling activity to non-gamblers. Thus, if we exposed this activity via digital (which I presumed) then it would not be helpful to the non-gamblers - exposing themselves to a decentralized gambling. Note that many people were poor - and if we continue to uphold this accessible gambling to everyone - it would still be the same as the problem you specified in your studies. The control over the use and the gamblers capability must be check.  However, this is quite an opportunist project and I see no problem except one mentioned above.
