TRAID is indeed a Youtube antidote. All instructors will be vetted and hand-picked...no shillers allowed. Such crypto professionals should (and will) be rewarded handsomly for broadcasting legit educational content. That's why most of the revenues  collected from their channels will go to them (unlike Youtube and other centralized video platforms).
