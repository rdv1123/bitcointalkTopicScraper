The bounty program continues. You can get your SLY tokens only after registration on the platform, and passing verification. After that, your tokens will be transferred to your user account. This is a necessary condition to get SLY tokens.  Now SELFLLERY gives an opportunity to get extra SLY tokens for participating in the referral program. For each friend who uses your referral link you will receive 88 SLY tokens as soon as a new user registers on SELFLLERY and passes verification. In the future, you will receive 10 percent of his tokens earned for likes on his photos. Terms of the referral program can be found here: https://selfllery.com/settings/referral  All this time we worked hard to improve the platform, to prepare for the ICO, and to go to the crypto-exchange. Your work helps us to move towards the goal quickly. Thanks for your work. Hopefully it will helps for all of bounties Hunters but i don't know if it still run or not due to still there are no other updating of the bounty program.",True

SELFLLERY is about to finish the 1st round of Token Sale in 70 hours.  Let us inform you about the news and our decisions related to development and the chosen way of the project according to our RoadMap and White Paper.  1. We announce the 2nd round of Public Token Sale, that will start on the 31st of May 2018. 2. To the moment when the 2nd round starts, SELFLLERY will have a fully operational platform on Ethereum blockchain with each Like being converted to YOU Token. 3. In the second round YOU Token will cost more than in the first round. During the second round YOU Token’s selling price will be going up. In the end of the second round emission value of 1 YOU Token will be 0.002 ETH. 4. We’ve made a decision to create a charity foundation and to freeze there 20 million of YOU Tokens (from total amount of 55 million of YOU Tokens emitted in the 1st round of TGE) for 1 year. 5. During the Roadshow* we have met a huge interest in our project. SELFLLERY is expecting to involve several investors in order to speed up further development of the platform. 6. Also due to strong interest to the platform on the part of Investment Funds and different investors we will hold a Private Second Round Sale.  Let us remind you: only 70 hours left till the end of the 1st ICO round. Now we also accept Bitcoin and some ERC20 tokens as the means of payment.  1. EOS (EOS) 2. Tron (TRX) 3. OmiseGo (OMG) 4.

As we promised we keep you informed about our road show. Now we're in Dubai, at Blockchain Middle East Forum. The conference took place from 5 to 6 of February and it was a successful one, from our point of view. Check it out at blockchainme.iqpc.ae. Why Dubai? Because it wants to become the first blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020. And it has all the chances, as we see it. Being the part of United Arab Emirates, it has the dependence on oil, that's why it develops the technologies, with the goal of becoming one of the biggest global business hubs, reducing the dependence. This goal attracts many public and private startups, and provides all the necessary conditions for domestic [Suspicious link removed]panies. Among speakers we saw many Dubai authorities, like Haroun Dharsey, Senior Vice President of Dubai Islamic Bank, Sultan Al Akraf, Head of Real Estate Registration of Dubai Land Department and Waleed Aldhuhouri, Head of Corporate Applications of Dubai Health Authority. But it's wasn't all about Dubai government, it was also about wonderful technologies. So we had a pleasure to hear about such companies as Bankex, Innoopolis, Altair, Bitcar and Shelterzoom. At conference, we met many colleagues, made some connections, saw many innovative startups and, of course, demonstrated our SELFLLERY platform to attendees and visitors. We're seeing some unstoppable interest to our product wherever we go. It has a real use application, and that's why our users base is growing constantly. Next stop? We'll keep posting the updates, so stay tuned! You can find photos from this event on our facebook https://www.facebook.com/Selfllery/",True

Anyone can get photos from the internet and monetize it. I also found a solution for my problem and i hope this is what the devs have come up also into their mind. To avoid this copyright issue, the user cannot upload photo instead they can only take photo using the platform or application. In this way, we can verify that each taken photo was really from the user. Although the quality of the photo will depend on the mobile of the user.

The product concept and its first versions were designed in early 2016. The Selfllery reward system is based on blockchain technology.    Selfllery enables people to make their visual content truly rewarding. The purpose of Selfllery is to create an ecosystem that: 1. Enables users to monetize their photos, videos and live streams in a gamified way; 2. Supports charitable organizations and makes donations easy for users; 3. Provides companies with easy-to-use and effective promotion tools that involve user photos; 4. Expands the market of photo and video content for companies and news services, with a convenient search functionality; 5. Integrates modern technologies and capabilities of blockchain into the digital photography market, increasing the transparency and security of its transactions.    Initially, YOU tokens are generated during the TGE based on the Ethereum platform. Buyers receive YOU in exchange for Ethereum (ETH) tokens by sending a payment to a smart contract that generates YOU tokens. The smart contract address will be published on official Selfllery website one day before the TGE start.  YOU token price: 1 YOU = 0.001 ETH The minimum goal (soft cap): 10 000 ETH The maximum goal (hard cap): 55 000 ETH Minimum purchase amount: 0.1 ETH  TGE will have two stages: pre-sale and main sale. At the pre-sale stage, YOU tokens are offered only to whitelisted buyers, whereas during the main sale tokens can be purchased by anyone. During pre-sale, early buyers can buy YOU tokens at a discount. For discounted YOU tokens, the minimum purchase amount is set at 10 ETH and tokens are locked up for at least one month after the main sale ends.    The Selfllery platform combines: - YOU Token - Monetizing Visual Content - Monetization of Social Activities - Stock Photo - Marketing platform - Charity platform - Photo-Quests and Photo-Contests    Initial Distribution of YOU Tokens generated during TGE: - YOU Token - Monetizing Visual Content - Monetization of Social Activities - Stock Photo - Marketing platform - Charity platform - Photo-Quests and Photo-Contests    Q1 2016 Idea, domain research Product concept definition  Q2 2016 Alpha version of Web interface Alpha version of Android application  Q3 2016 Inside testing of the WEB interface Inside testing of the Android application  Q4 2016 Beta version of Android application User testing of the service  Q1 2017 Market research and analysis White Paper preparation  Q2 2017 Economic model validation Advisor consulting  Q3 2017 Pre-launch of TGE  Q4 2017 Pre-TGE campaign launch Pre-TGE launch Photo contest module Charity module Expansion of the team for TGE  Q1 2018 TGE Launch Team expansion Marketplace Advertising module Photo editing filters Beta version of iOS application  Q2 2018 >FUTURE Additional modules development Global marketing campaign  Indonesian https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2775143 Thanks to portgas313 Turkish https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2779283 Thanks to hbcenk Chinese https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2784596 Thanks to kkndkill Hindi https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2829920 Thanks to imtiazmahmood Japanese https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2841396 Thanks to imtiazmahmood Spanish https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2768446 Thanks to EdChain",True
