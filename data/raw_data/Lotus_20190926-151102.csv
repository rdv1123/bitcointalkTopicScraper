For example, Steam or GOG could use the Lotus protocol and list digital game cartridges if they wanted, but we don't think that's likely to occur as long as they support a centralized distribution model.  Some key differences between buying a game from Steam and buying a game with the Lotus protocol are:  1. Steam lends you a ""license to play"" that can lock you out from your purchased game given certain circumstances. The Lotus Protocol gives you a digital game that you own forever or until you decide to trade it with someone else. 2. Steam won't let you share ""your"" games so easily or will put restrictions when they let you share them, because those games are not really yours. The Lotus Protocol allows you to freely lend, trade or sell YOUR digital games with anyone freely. 3. Steam store takes away 30% of sales revenue from game developers. Lotus Store will grant 100% of sales revenue to developers, (devs even get rewarded every time someone makes a transaction with Lotus Tokens and a game they made).",False

Sure, existing DRM platforms will be strong contenders. But aside from the advantages and opportunities for Lotus Core (which can be found at http://lotuscore.io/whitepaper), our biggest competitive advantage is the Lotus Protocol.  By using smart contracts, the Lotus Protocol protects digital assets from piracy and also compensates creators per transactions made by the owners of the digital asset. A game developer can self-distribute their own game, or different marketplaces can use the Lotus Protocol to securely and fairly distribute digital games. Our open distribution protocol can be used by any game developer or marketplace in the world. So Lotus Core will not be alone.",False
