First of all with regard to the actual features, what you are saying are some possibilities offered by the application but it goes further. For the beverages orders, it is not simply to avoid ordering at the counter, it can nevertheless be a time saver, but it is mainly to propose the order in a decentralized way. Since you can visualize who is in a bar, and especially where your Facebook friends are, you will be able to offer a drink to whatever place you are located respectively. If your friend is in a bar in New York and you live in France, there is no limit. For the Tip feature, again it's not just about tipping through the app only to the waiter you have in front of you. Employees present using the app will all be able to receive a tip, ie not only the waiter but also the people you never see, the cooks for example. You will be able to choose any employee. In addition, the app also provides details about the crowd in real time in all places to our users.  In a second time, we agree with you that human contact will always be better than the virtual side. However, society is evolving and the digital revolution is creating new needs. Our app offers a service that responds to a request. You can offer a drink to a stranger directly, it will help shy people for example. The goal is to use the application as an icebreaker in your social relations. Also, today you have the opportunity to buy on the Internet like buying a product in a real shop. To make a long story short, these are adaptations.  Finally, you have to understand that we put forward this cryptocurrency in the context of our own application. But it will also be used in other dating applications in the future when partenerships will be developped.  We thank you for your question ",False

We summarize our project by decentralizing order and payment processes, but we must keep in mind all the features to appreciate its value. Indeed, the interest of our application does not lie in the mere fact of ordering drinks. It also allows to interact with people in the same bar via encrypted messaging, to know the name and the sentimental status of unknown people until then, to offer a drink to people you like and to your friends wherever they are. It is much more enjoyable to receive a free drink from one of your friend at the other end of the world, it can put you in a good mood when you see people are thinking about you. More than just sending them money, which loses all its charm.  You will be also able to tip every employee and not only the waiter. As you are able to view people in the same place, you will see every single employee using the app i.e the barman, the cook, you will have a wider choice and really have the opportunity to thank each person. It will be interesting in countries, for instance in France, inasmuch as tip is not included in bill. It can really encourage tipping in countries where it is not a common practise.  In addition, the application mainly allows to know the crowd in real time in all the establishments and to be able to choose the place where to spend your evening according to targeted criteria (very frequented or rather peaceful place).  Therefore, the purpose of the app is to optimize your outings, meetings and social relationships by creating interactions. We really want to break with dating applications that sometimes lead to unhealthy trends, which ultimately degrade the meeting and the quality of social relationships.  This system will also be advantageous to establishments owners. They can take advantage of our app and not have to create their own system, it is  time and money saving. In addition, they will profit from two proposed cocktails especially created for our features. From a marketing view, it can lead to attract new customers.  The idea is to create a community and distinctive sign around our project in order to promote meetings in all ways.  Finally, we will be the first proximity meeting mobile app to use the technology of the blockchain and not to store on a centralized server the personal and intimate information of the user such as his first name, sexual and religious orientation and many others.  The Ethereum and BigchainDB blockchains will enable to manage interactions between people within these establishments.",False
