We are devoted to enhancing our customers’ trading experiences with quick trade execution, fair pricing, world-class customer service, endless improvement and limitless creativity. The main purpose of our Souk Tokens are the following:  1. Tokens will be redeemable to pay trading, transfer and other fees at a discount of at least 30%. We reserve the right to create special promotions and windows where token discounts on fees will be higher for a period of time, but they will always be worth a discount of at least 30%. Certain pre-ICO and early ICO coin buyers will get an additional discount applied to the general fee discount.  2. Tokens will be the method of payment for the listing of new asset pairs from projects that also meet our diligence review for soundness.  3. The company will, after $1,000,000.00 in initial profit as calculated under standard IFRS rules, use 20% of it’s quarterly profit from the previous quarter to acquire and burn SOUK tokens from the market in the current quarter. The company has the right to purchase tokens before the $1 million milestone and can, at its option, acquire more than the required 20% in any given quarter at its sole election. The company will continue to acquire SOUK tokens until there are less than 5.6 million outstanding tokens.

First we think that being able to transfer fiat currency in and out as inexpensively as possible and as native to Dinars, Dirhams, Riyals and Dollars as possible is critical. To that end we plan to invest in tools and partners who can help us lower those costs and make funding or redeeming fiat inexpensive and easy. Second, we believe that, though not all crypto assets are worthy of listing on our exchange, that the diversity of trading pairs and crypto assets will be an important factor that customers will look to when they choose a preferred exchange. Third, we believe that higher touch customer service is critical in this region so we plan to invest in customer service to be able to provide a more human touch at scale while doing so efficiently and profitably. Last but not least, the teams localized knowledge of KYC/AML relevant documentation will play a key role in providing a unique and frictionless user experience.",False

To that end we plan to invest in tools and partners who can help us lower those costs and make funding or redeeming fiat inexpensive and easy. We plan to use our token to reward our early supporters. Buyers of the SOUK utility token will get discounts on trading fees and other costs if paid for in SOUK tokens. Tokens will be redeemable to pay trading, transfer and other fees at a discount of at least 30%. I hope this answers your questions.   Best Regards,  MaZeeCM",False

Soft cap is the minimum amount of money a cryptocurrency can receive from investors in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO). An ICO is a limited-time process by which new cryptocurrencies make their coins publicly known and begin selling them directly to people while hardcap is the maximum amount a crowdsale will receive.

We will provide more details on that in the future.  TOKENS WILL BE UTILIZED IN THREE PRIMARY WAYS: 1. Tokens will be redeemable to pay trading, transfer and other fees at a discount of at least 30%. We reserve the right to create special promotions and windows where token discounts on fees will be higher for a period of time, but they will always be worth a discount of at least 30%. Certain pre-ICO and early ICO coin buyers will get an additional discount applied to the general fee discount. 2. Tokens will be the method of payment for the listing of new asset pairs from projects that also meet our diligence review for soundness. 3. The company will, after $1,000,000.00 in initial profit as calculated under standard IFRS rules, use 20% of it’s quarterly profit from the previous quarter to acquire and burn SOUK tokens from the market in the current quarter. The company has the right to purchase tokens before the $1 million milestone and can, at its option, acquire more than the required 20% in any given quarter at its sole election. The company will continue to acquire SOUK tokens until there are less than 5.6 million outstanding tokens.

This week breaking news about Malta introducing Virtual Financial Assets Act, which is great and welcomed news and exactly why we have chosen Malta (VFA Act).  However, the sudden change in the regulatory requirements in Malta has forced us to temporarily delay the launch of the public token pre-sale initially set for July 9th 2018. As a transitional period has been implemented to permit all entities get up to speed with the new laws which require all new companies such as Cryptosouk to provide a legal opinion with respect to the token utility and prove that it does not require any further regulatory approvals within the framework of financial regulated activities (i.e. security tokens).  Our expectation of the new act coming in to force and we were initially advised that this legal opinion would not be required to incorporate the company at the outset, yet would be required by the last quarter of this year. However, as mentioned above, with the immediate requirement, we are now required to submit the legal opinion to complete the incorporation process at the outset, so in our quest to remain fully compliant with all jurisdictions we intend to operate in, we have a fiduciary duty to operate properly as to not put any of own clients and community at risk.  We are now awaiting more accurate feedback from the company registry and our Maltese legal counsel E&S Group as to the best possible date to launch the pre-sale post full completion of the legal opinion and incorporation. We expect to be able to announce this very shortly as the document required is a mere formality.  We are genuinely grateful for the overwhelming support our community has provided us within such a short period and commit to always being as diligent as possible from all fronts. The Maltese Legislators forward looking approach by introducing this, the new act is welcomed news and we feel a minor delay is worth it, to ensure we are structured correctly for the benefit of all concerned for get-go.  While our lawyers are dealing with this matter, it will give us an opportunity to focus on the amazing response characterized by the several thousand users that signup up for our trading platform at www.cryptosouk.exchange! As part of our roadmap, we intend to fund all accounts with $1000 demo funds in order for our user base to test the majority of the platform features. The feedback from this exercise will be invaluable to us in addition to be hopeful that the community will share their experience throughout all available media channels.  David Dubrulle  CEO",False
