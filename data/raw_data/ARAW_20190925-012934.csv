Araw token started with 390,000,000 ARAW SOLD in 'private events', We can assume they sold the tokens at generous 60% of the token value .01 USD,  and fix the ETH price at 700USD, (real price was about 400USD), the real money they got in the presales event was: (.40 * (400/700) * .01 * 390,000,000) = 891,428 USD and not 3,900,000 how they claim in several parts 3. Finally  the number of token sold at Aug 30th, is 952,000,500 , they sold a lot of them in their 15 days of campaign when the discount value was bteween 40% - 50%, let use the value at 40%. and the ETH value is 300USD aprox the value .6 * (300/700) * .01 * (952,000,500 - 390,000,000) = 1,445,156  Total: 1,445,156  +  891,428 = 2,336,584 USD  and not the 9,000,000 USD that the people claims in this forum and in other public Web Site Can we trust in this kind of company?.  --Best The ICO trust team.",False

For most commercial businesses, cryptocurrency is becoming a preferred mode of transaction highlighted by its current cap of hundreds of billions and expected to rise to trillions. According to research, most of the finance and banking industry is expected to move to the blockchain and hence adoption rate of blockchain across all industries will increase in the coming years. By Introducing the ARAW Token, the heart of the decentralised payment ecosystem powered by the Ethereum Blockchain, we are aiming to increase blockchain adoption for regular people across the world. We are the first company in the UK whose mission is to combine the benefits of the E-Commerce and Payment industries; provide end-toend solutions for E-Commerce Marketplace, Touch & Pay Cryptocurrency Card, Online Cryptocurrency Payment, and Unified Reward System on the Ethereum Blockchain powered by the ARAW token. The goal of the ARAW token is to be a part of everyone’s day-to-day online & in-store shopping. The Araw platform addresses fundamental problems in the e-commerce and cryptocurrency economies. Firstly, retailers online and offline offer restrictive reward systems bundled with their services - they are often of little value to the consumer given their limited nature. Reward systems in commerce as a whole are underutilised due to the lack of technological investment. Coincidentally, many companies find it difficult to provide attractive reward schemes as they risk undervaluing their services. The ‘Unified Reward System’ allows service providers to become an ARAW token distributor, allowing them to control the format of their reward plans. The ARAW token now acts as more than a simple reward point - as it is utilised and redeemable across all of ARAW’s ecosystem participants. Additionally, owners of ARAW are able to convert their tokens into fiat currencies via ARAW mobile wallet & take cashback to their associated bank account",False

We like that the use of ICO proceeds is diversified across various categories ranging from sales and support and legal to sales and marketing and R&D. This is an indication of a project that is more mature than others that remain in the conceptual stage, which diminishes the risk. That’s not to say that there are no risks, as ARAW is debuting into a market where competing payment and e-commerce tokens have a headstart. The rewards feature is a nice touch and could help to incentivize consumers and businesses alike to climb onboard. Risks     While ARAW is developing a comprehensive ecosystem for the e-commerce market that aims to deliver seamless blockchain transactions to the masses, it’s not the only company doing this. In fact, it sounds a lot like Dash, whose instant pay feature is similarly designed to usher in micro-payments to the blockchain and which offers consumers a privacy feature. Meanwhile, DASH coin has been under pressure of late, which provides a more challenging environment for an e-commerce play like ARAW to make its debut. (-2) Growth Opportunity     Investors who are interested in the ARAW token sale must go through the know-your-customer process. This involves white-list registration and providing any required information to prove your identity. The fact that ARAW is pursuing regulatory compliance in the jurisdictions in which it plans to operate is a positive in an environment that is moving closer toward global regulation. (+2)     ARAW is in discussions with exchanges to list its ARAW token. While the startup declines to identify these trading platforms until it’s a done deal, the fact that the discussions are under way is a positive sign for traders who are interested in the project, as it will provide liquidity. Plus there is a bounty program and airdrop on the roadmap. (+2)     ARAW has the benefit of experience with two years of operations under its belt. The ICO is designed to fund an expansion, one that involves a move to a decentralized platform on the Ethereum network as well as a 2020 push into the U.S. and Asia. (+3)     Despite the competition, ARAW is a participant in a robust payment and e-commerce space, the latter of which is projected to reach $4.5 trillion in sales in the next three years, according to the ARAW white paper. ARAW also cites another statistic, which is that “10% of the world’s GDP will be created on the blockchain by 20205.” All of these market statistics help to make the case for another e-commerce and payment platform. (+2.5) Disposition We arrive at a score of 7.5 out of a possible 10 for the ARAW ICO. Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-araw/  This is an excellent estimate! 7.5/10",False

For most commercial businesses, cryptocurrency is becoming a preferred mode of transaction highlighted by its current cap of hundreds of billions and expected to rise to trillions. According to research, most of the finance and banking industry is expected to move to the blockchain and hence adoption rate of blockchain across all industries will increase in the coming years.  By Introducing the ARAW Token, the heart of the decentralized e-commerce & payment ecosystem powered by the Ethereum Blockchain. We are the first company in the United Kingdom and around the world whose mission is to combine the benefits of the E-Commerce and Payment industries; provide end-to-end solutions for E-Commerce Marketplace, Touch & Pay Cryptocurrency Card, Online Cryptocurrency Payment, and Unified Reward System on the Ethereum Blockchain powered by the ARAW token. The goal of the ARAW token is to be a part of everyone’s day-to-day online & in-store shopping.  The ARAW platform addresses fundamental problems in the e-commerce and cryptocurrency economies. Firstly, retailers online and offline offer restrictive reward systems bundled with their services — they are often of little value to the consumer given their limited nature. Reward systems in commerce as a whole are under-utilised due to the lack of technological investment. Coincidentally, many companies find it difficult to provide attractive reward schemes as they risk undervaluing their services. The ‘Unified Reward System’ allows service providers to become an ARAW token distributor, allowing entities to control the format of their reward plans. The ARAW token now acts as more than a simple reward point — as it is utilised and redeemable across all of ARAW’s ecosystem participants. Additionally, owners of ARAW are able to convert their tokens into fiat currencies via ARAW mobile wallet & take cashback to their associated bank account.  Secondly, the complex barrier to entry into the cryptocurrency market limits the potential value of the crypto market as a whole. The technologies surrounding ARAW are strategically built for the platform to support a ‘Unified Reward System’ — ensuring ease of adoption and maximizing consumer outreach. While the ‘Unified Reward System’ makes it possible to standardize reward tokens across industries, the ARAW token will also allow regular customers to have a stake in the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency world — benefitting all parties involved. The key factors include the ease of adoption for the customer as reward schemes are already common. While the needs of an enterprise entity are met with ARAW’s technological offerings discussed in detail in the paper.",False

The virtual card is going to be our quick solution to achieve great adoption across the globe and Merchant Mobile App will be able to recognize Customer App virtual card for payments. We are aiming to integrate virtual card with Apple / Google Pay to enable touch-and-pay transactions to any card readers but this will be in our next phase after we have partnered with visa/master card - this will be our biggest challenge which we aim to start in Mid 2020.  For Physical card; based on your location and our support (we are going to start with the UK and then expand in Europe); there will be one-off minor fees for the physical card. We have few marketing strategies to increase the card adoption across the regular people and make them accustomed to present ARAW card for their daily payment.,False

Reward system always drags its members to keep on using the card as much as possible to squeen out every reward they could get. Rewards are more like gold, you value them, it's value increases everytime. I hope ARAW will have a market cap later on where it will compete with bitcoin and ethereum.",False
