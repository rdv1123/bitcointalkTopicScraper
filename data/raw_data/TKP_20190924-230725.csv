Low fees,"   Hello!  1) Withdrawal fee for TKP (as well as for other altcoins) will be revising in accordance with the market value of TKP (or other altcoins). For example, the higher a market price the lower fee will be charged for withdrawals.  2) There will be TWO basic approaches to deposit bounty stakes for trading:  FIRST. We contract with a project (which satisfy our reliability requirements) running a bounty. After that, any hunter participating in that bounty could deposit up to 50-70% of his stakes (earned on the current moment) to TOKPIE and trade them. A user will have to prove that he is a person (eligible hunter) by performing authentification procedure on TOKPIE side and claim the number of stakes he is willing to deposit.  SECOND. Any hunter could deposit bounty stakes of any reliable project after he places in hold a TKP collateral. When hunter deposits tokens related to the bounty stakes he had deposited previously, TOKPIE releases collateral. The size of the collateral and special requirements to a hunter (like good trust history or/and Full Member and upper level) will be announced later.    The First approach will be launch in 4-5 weeks, but the second will be applied in approximately 2 months.",False

Low fees,"Hello Fellows, What a completely new type of service can be provided to “crypto people” and start-ups, which are ongoing initial coin offer. It seems that every NEED for service is full of supply: trackers, forums like that, news, experts, etc. But we, in TOKPIE, don’t agree.  What is about listing and trading in bounty 'stakes' that were earned by not yet converted into tokens. Yes, it's probably a little bit crazy/raw idea, but imagine the following:  PROBLEM     A hunter is earning Stakes of X-name Company but wants to sell it urgently for fiat, cryptocurrency or exchange for 'stakes' of another company.     Who will buy? another hunter who strongly believe in the project success or any other person.     The problem is that there is no solution in the market allowing making such types of deals.      SOLUTION    1) Tokpie creates “stake” crypto derivative and encapsulate it into the an Instrument of the following type:     [SWAP - X_Stake_N%/quote currency - SWAP]      Where,     X is the name of a company that provides stakes     N% is the allocation of tokens to the specific campaign (e.g. 30% on blogs, video, etc)     Quote currency is ANY fiat currency, ANY cryptocurrency, or ANY other crypto derivative.   We have just tested it in TOKPIE MVP and created Order Book for Instrument [SWAP – X_Stakes _30%/ ETH - SWAP]  (Figure 1). Users could buy, sell this Instrument, bargain on price, monitor through the watchlist, set price signals, make analysis on the price chart, etc.    2) TOKPIE provides a company X with a bounty management service (in the box). The result there is no need for the Company X provides TOKPIE with the data flow [our internal user ID + how many stakes he earned).  TOKPIE top-ups the balances of the related users with “stake” derivative in accordance with their earnings.    3) A user can buy and sell the stakes he has on its balance on TOKPIE exchange just as any other Instrument (Figure 2).     4) If the bounty campaign is over successfully a Company X provides TOKPIE with the tokens. TOKPIE executes the related “stake” crypto derivatives (removes them from the listing) and top-ups users with the tokens in the proper proportion in accordance with their balances on the date/time of execution.   WHAT IS THE PROFIT for TOKPIE?      A) charge company X with a one-payment fee nominated in TKP that would be lower than the average market price for bounty management service   OR     B) charge users (hunters) with a low subscription fee nominated in TKP for the access to such Order Books (picture above)  WHAT IS THE BENEFIT for a TOKPIE token's (TKP) holder? The overall demand on TKP tokens could be increased.   This is just one example of how entirely new market niche can be created and served by the TOKPIE exchange.  ",False

Low fees,"   Thank you for your question and chance to show you how we differ;  TOKPIE is not just another P2P exchange, where people simply place and match with peers’ advertisements, or an online broker service. It's something entirely new.  On our platform, people and companies can trade and swap crypto and fiat through live auctions!  The creativity is in that:   Each auction, or instrument, is a unique combination of these factors: - Country - Base cryptocurrency - Quote currency - Payment method For example, {USA - BTC/USD - Bank of America} or {SWAP - BTC/ETH - SWAP]     The concept of encapsulating country, base/quote currency, and payment method into a unique tradable instrument allows us to provide the following basic features, all already tested in MVP (will be released 27/04/2018 before 24:00 UTC ):   1) Order placement People can trade instruments with each other directly in non-stop, simultaneous two-sided auctions having order books with 10 level market depth.     2) Charting tool Traders can analyze trends by applying easily accessible technical analysis tools.       3) Spread analysis  Traders with funds in different countries or on different accounts (PayPal, banks, etc.) can instantly discover where to buy and resell with the highest profit margin.      And many other useful features can be applied. No any limits! We can make dark order books for companies (and big whale traders), we can use encapsulation for P2P or B2P lending by creating instruments like that [Russ – Bond*365d*0.5LTV/RUB - Sberbank], etc.  Kindly look at our wp to find more details: https://tokpie.io/assets/downloads/tokpie_whitepaper.pdf",False

Moreover, the principle of ""encapsulation into tradable instruments"" allows TOKPIE to provide traders with additional features unattainable in any other P2P exchanges:      Cross-Exchange Spread Trade Analysis for Brokerage     Dark Pool Order Books     Full Dark Pool Order Books     B2B Order Books for crypto-fiat trades     Crypto Indexes     Crypto Index funds     Crypto Futures     Crypto Options     P2P Decentralized Lending     Infrastructure for 3rd party Token Sales & Listings  Everything is conveniently and organically combined into one TOKPIE ecosystem.  2.

Multilevel allifiliate program will be applied (3-levels)   There are many other incentives in each category but I listed the most important.    P.S.

To achieve real business success, Tokpie needs to demonstrate that it is aiming for more than short-term financial gains, what is most important to us is providing the best possible service for our users.   2. Reputation and public perception By implementing KYC and AML regulations from the initial token sale, Tokpie will ensure that the platform is protected from potential fraud.  3. Ability to reach a larger audience. Having KYC and AML safeguards in place will allow Tokpie to attract a much larger audience and expand its reach into countries which operate more stringent financial regulatory requirements.  4. Avoid Compliance Complications By being transparent with financial regulators from the start, we can avoid complications which could arise  5. Keeping track after the token sale Incorporating KYC and AML checks into the token sale process can help the platform keep track of investors (not allow restricted countries' participation)  6. Avoid fines. Governments have begun to clamp down on unregulated exchanges, charging substantial fines for those platforms which have failed to show that they have the necessary statutory procedures in place. In 2017 it was predicted that fines of over $4billion would be issued globally for non-compliance with AML.",False

Low fees,"                                              TOKPIE is not just another P2P exchange, where people simply place and match with peers’ advertisements, or an online broker service. It's something entirely new.  On our platform, people and companies can trade and swap crypto and fiat through live auctions!  Each auction, or instrument, is a unique combination of these factors: - Country - Base cryptocurrency - Quote currency - Payment method For example, {USA - BTC/USD - Bank of America}     The concept of encapsulating country, base/quote currency, and payment method into a unique tradable instrument allows us to provide the following basic features, all already tested in MVP (90% ready):   1) Order placement People can trade instruments with each other directly in non-stop, simultaneous two-sided auctions having order books with 10 level market depth.     2) Charting tool Traders can analyze trends by applying easily accessible technical analysis tools.       3) Spread analysis  Traders with funds in different countries or on different accounts (PayPal, banks, etc.) can instantly discover where to buy and resell with the highest profit margin.      4) Top 10 movers Users can reveal up to ten instruments where prices have increased or decreased at a higher percentage rate than anywhere else in a preset time period.     5) Top 10 markets Traders can detect most profitable quotes via real-time lists of quotes, sorted by price descending (for sellers) or ascending (for buyers) order.     6) Watchlist Users constantly stay up to date on the latest bids, asks, the last matched price, and percentage of change for the selected instruments.     7) Price Alerts Traders can catch the most favorable conditions for the best deals.     With TOPKIE, traders get a platform that offers: - the pros of centralized exchanges (Bitfinex, Kraken, CEX, etc.), including ability to trade in order books, analyzing market depth, receiving price alerts, etc. and, - the pros of P2P exchanges, where users only pay for the fiat money transfer to a counterparty, bypassing intermediaries and the risks of centralized exchanges.  Plus, TOKPIE offers its users unlimited scalability options, allowing to trade any crypto asset or its derivative in P2P, B2B, dark pool order books mode, receive and make loans, benefit from our infrastructure for 3rd party token sales, and many other applications.

Low fees,"   Yes, ever users will have the rating score. A user will be caring for its reputation because a high rating score gives access to other features like p2p loans, leverages, etc.   Also, the honesty of the transactions will be supported by:  - verification process for all users. A cheater could not make his scam action twice.  - Risk coverage. We cover the risk of deal's non-fulfillment (when you send money but don't receive a crypto-asset from a counterparty), so a buyer will not suffer in any way from 'scam' actions. And visa-verse.
