In other words, it’s the platform where you execute your crypto trade. Are you interested in crypto trading and looking for an exchange of late? Well, there is no dearth of crypto exchanges today but there is a catch- not all would be compatible and safe for you. Multiple considerations have to be made while choosing a crypto exchange. The post below offers the major tips to keep in mind to choose the right exchange.  Check for regulation and license  An unregulated and non-licensed exchange is not trustworthy. When an exchange is under regulation, it has to abide by certain, rules, standards and protocols that prevent it from carrying fake and fraudulent measures. Thus, a regulated exchange always assures a credible trading atmosphere.  Look for decentralized exchange  Most of the crypto exchanges are centralized in nature. A centralized structure is very opaque and users don’t have the opportunity here to have a first-hand view of the happenings in the exchange. They have to trust whatever information is published by the centralized authority governing the exchange. As a result, many centralized exchanges have been found to produce inauthentic and inflated trading data to lure more users. And users had no clue that they were being duped.  Thus, it’s better to look for a decentralized exchange which boasts a transparent environment and that eliminates risks of fake data from them.  Consider the safety factor  This is certainly one of the most important aspects to keep in mind while looking for a crypto exchange. Make sure to find a crypto exchange which keeps maximum of its funds in cold wallet. These are offline wallets and hence beyond the reach of cyber hackers.  Highly potential coins  As an aspiring crypto trader, you are definitely eyeing on high returns from your crypto trade. But for that, you have to choose those coins that can actually promise of higher yields. Thus, make sure your chosen exchange lists all major coins and altcoins that are expected to boast a highly prospective future.  Decoin could be a promising name here. It is an emerging crypto exchange which has taken the revolutionary approach of adopting a decentralized structure to ensure a fair, transparent and trustworthy trading environ for users. Interestingly, it follows the unique model of revenue sharing with users where it shares 20% of its revenue with its token holders. The exchange is extremely careful of safety and stores 97% percent funds in cold wallet. Decoin also extends 24/7 multilingual call centers worldwide so that you can reach up to the support team, anytime you need to.",False

There is no denying of the fact that traditional financial institutions like banks or stock exchanges were initially not really encouraging of the new phenomenon of digital assets. But times are changing. The crypto market is on a steady stride of late and the conventional financial institutions seem to have finally found some kind of potential in digital coins.  The fact that mainstream financial bodies are now embracing the crypto industry is visibly evident from NYSE’s (New York Stock Exchange) recent step last May. The esteemed exchange created quite a stir in the fintech tinsel town lately by releasing the BTC (Bitcoin) price index- officially known as “NYXBT”. The launch happened on may 19, 2019.  NYXBT would be representing the daily USD value of 1 BTC at around 4 p.m. (BST). The value would be published right on the Global Index Feed of NYSE. In fact, it can be viewed on NYSE’s official website for limited time.  “BTC values are fast becoming a crucial data point which our users wish to follow. We have observed users are keen into investing, trading and transacting with this rising asset class”, stated Thomas Farley, the honorable group president of NYSE.  “Being a leader of global index as well as administrator of the ICE Futures American Dollar Index, ICE LIBOR and several other major benchmarks, we are looking forward to introduce transparency into this market.”  The BTC price index would utilize data from the transactions that are occurring on leading BTC exchange Coinbase.  “It’s a great thing to see that traditional leading financial institutions such as NYSE are finally taking pro-active steps to accept and operate with crypto assets. We are looking forward to a bright future of crypto in tryst with major financial bodies”, noted Sydney Ifergan, crypto expert and advisor of emerging crypto exchange Decoin. Decoin even has its own native coin under the name “DTEP”.  NYSE’s recent move with BTC is supposedly inspired by Wall Street exchange’s investment in the funding round of Coinbase.  “With this very investment, we’re looking to tap into a new form of asset class in partnership with a major portal which is bringing security, transparency & also confidence to a major growth market”, Farley added in.  Added to NYSE, other traditional financial institutions have taken active participation in the crypto world of late. Multinational banking leader Goldman Sachs invested in BTC financial service company Circle recently. Bank of NY Mellon Corp had also started to experiment with BTC’s open-source code for its corporate program.",False

Read the article onsite HERE   New crypto traders beware! If you find a crypto exchange claiming incredible trading volumes, be careful. Leading US crypto fund management company Bitwise has recently published a report to SEC citing 95% of exchanges produce fake data on trading volume. And that’s NOT a good thing. Such kinds of inflated information mislead the traders and draw them to an incompetent platform- only to end up with unyielding results.  As per the market reports, a lot of exchanges today are pumping the trading volume though unethical practices like bot trading or wash trading. In fact, some of them are even presenting the trading volume of other exchanges as their own to leverage their platform through illicit means. They take the help of API or MM or bots to present such fraudulent data.  But why do these exchanges fake their trading volume?  “Inflated volume data make a crypto exchange appear bigger in the market. Such pumped-up data also enables the exchange to show higher liquidity than it truly holds. In fact, a staggering volume even catapults the exchange on top of CMC rankings. And, crypto traders usually prefer to trader with exchanges with high CMC ranks. Put simply, exchanges take the misleading inflated route to pull in more traffic to their portal”, stated Sydney Ifergan, crypto pundit and advisor of Decoin exchange.  A bigger pumped-up profile enables a crypto exchange to charge higher fees for projects that are aspiring to list coins on that platform. According to reports, around 100 million USD have been stolen by unethical exchanges with the help of spiked trade volume data.  Pitfall of centralized structure  As per the experts, the possibility of producing fake volume data is abetted by the typical centralized structure of the exchanges. Unfortunately, most of the exchanges you will find now are centralized. As these exchanges are governed by one single central authority, the facts and figures of these exchanges are always opaque to public.  Decentralized structure eliminates the risk  As per crypto experts, a decentralized exchange is the best possible solution here. A decentralized infrastructure is not controlled by one single authority. Thus, such exchanges are always more transparent with their facts and operations which duly eliminates the risk of claiming an inflated volume data. Put simply a decentralized exchange assures a fairer marketplace compared to a centralized one.  Decoin is a decentralized exchange that promises no threat of fake volume data. In fact, it also offers an exclusive revenue sharing protocol that further prevents any attempt to claim inflated data.  “At Decoin, we believe in slow but steady growth. We sincerely condemn any attempt to produce misleading inflated data and we always stand for a fair and reliable trading environment, added in Mr. Ifergan.",False

Unregulated exchanges can’t be trusted for safe trading as these can always take illicit and fraudulent means given the lack of regulations. Thus, when you will check out a crypto exchange, make sure its website or whitepaper clearly mentions about its regulation status. If you don’t find any such data, consider a red flag. Are you in quest of a regulated crypto exchange? Check out the article below as it offers a brief on the top regulated crypto exchanges you can count on.  HitBTC  Founded in 2013, the platform claims to be the “best advanced crypto exchange” in the world. The exchange is under regulation and is all set to launch its licensed subsidiary soon in Japan. HitBTC operates with a state of the art matching algorithm and the exchange is solely for crypto-to-crypto trading. Although the platform does not support fiat currency yet users here are able to purchase BTC with credit card  Huobi  Huobi is a China-based crypto exchange that is registered in Republic of Seychelles. It’s headquarter is in Singapore and the exchange also has multiple offices across Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and the USA. Huobi operates with various versions. There is its OTC portal which allows fiat-to-crypto trading without any kind of fees. You also have Huobi Pro which is meant for crypto-to-crypto trading for advanced traders. The Pro version extends round the clock customer service.  Decoin  Decoin is a fast rising crypto exchange and it also has its own native coin by the name of DTEP. You will be relieved to know the company is regulated and licensed by Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit. Decoin promises easy trading for both new and seasoned traders. DTEP holders have access to discounted trading fees and the exchange’s unique revenue sharing program. As per the program, Decoin shares 20% of its revenue with its coin holders. Decoin has taken strict security measures and stores 97% of its assets in cold wallet. The remaining assets are backed by insurance.  BitMEX  BitMEX is especially built for dedicated crypto traders. The platform continuously processes more than 2 billion USD in transactions in 24-hour period. One of the most unique aspects of the portal is that it extends leveraged contracts (perpetual contracts and futures contracts) which are sold and purchased with Bitcoin. BitMEX is registered in Republic of Seychelles.",False

Over the years, crypto exchanges have been the victims of illicit hackers that has led to losses in millions. Here is a brief on some of the most high-profile hacks that shook the crypto world in recent times:  DAO- 53 million USD Bitfinex- 72 million USD Parity- 30 million + 275 million USD Coincheck- 530 million USD Binance- 40 million USD The worst sufferers of these hacks are the crypto investors or traders themselves. Your safety is your responsibility and you have to take pro-active steps to keep your assets safe from hackers. The post below offers some pro security tips for all crypto users.  Be careful of secured storage  It’s better to store your digital assets in some offline cold wallet. Fewer tokens you place online, fewer are the risks of them getting hacked. Your wallet should be locked properly while you are not using it. The private keys must be kept offline, away from wallet. You can keep the keys in some bank safe for safety. Another tip here would be to implement multi passphrases on wallet which will help to hide the balance of primary wallet.  Experts have also advised to follow multisignature practices for wallet hands.  Choose exchange wisely  This is certainly one of the most important points to consider while it comes to the security of your crypto assets. Look for an exchange which stores maximum of the crypto funds in cold wallet. Decoin exchange is a good example here as it stores 97% of its crypto funds in cold wallet. Although the remaining 3% is stored in hot wallet for easy liquidity yet those are backed by insurance. Also don’t sore your entire crypto asset portfolio in your exchange. Limit the amount to what will be specifically required for exchange and trading.  Besides, always settle with a licensed and regulated exchange which is extremely careful about advanced security practices on its portal.  Double-check wallet address  According to market experts, a crypto wallet user should always double-check wallet address when he pastes it. You should follow the same precaution when you supply the address through chat or email or via any form of digital communication.  Try to avoid discussing about your crypto ventures in public forums, especially online public forums. You never know who is lurking behind the camouflage of a new-found friend on these forums.",False
