So far, 2018 has been fast-paced and eventful — expect many more announcements and partnerships moving forward!  Pre-Sale Success  We successfully raised ~$12,000,000 USD during our pre-sale that ended on January 21. With over 1,000 contributions from 80 different countries, we’ve raised a total of 10,300 Ethereum, which at the closing market rate was equivalent to $11,850,781 USD. This means that we already have 21,396,597 FTX tokens to be distributed to our supporters. Thank you again for your support!  FintruX Hits the Road  Seoul. We thoroughly enjoyed our roadshow in South Korea! We presented FintruX Network on January 18 at the Token Post Blockchain January event, and on the 19th at the Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and Beyond event. Speaking at these events along with several other blockchain companies, start-ups, scholars and community leaders from all over the world was a great experience. We’ve been able to extend our network of contacts in the Asian market and we’re looking forward to much more expansion in the region in the months to come.  Save the Date!  We have only a few days left until the start of our token sale on February 7. Early contributors will be rewarded with a 5% bonus, so please make sure you register for the whitelist as soon as possible. We already have over 11,000 applicants and we have structured the sale for fair distribution of our tokens.  We will be closing our whitelist on Tuesday, February 6th. For the last 5M raised in our sale, a cap of 5 ETH per transaction will be implemented; ensuring our tokens will be in the hands of as many supporters as possible.  https://medium.com/fintrux/january-in-review-9f1b565f5b8f",False

They have a plan for these situations in which the borrower don't pay. You can see it at the whitepaper, sure. Good to know it. Anybody knows where can I find it, in what page?   Page 2 gives an overview. Basically there is 10% of each loan collected as collateral, plus guarantors, plus third party insurance. There is also this from earlier in this thread:  Quote from: FintruX on November 21, 2017, 08:45:17 AM Quote from: styca on November 20, 2017, 07:07:26 PM The front page of the website and the opening post in this ANN thread do a very good job of explaining the nature of the project and what makes FintruX stand out from the competition. One thing I would love to see though is some example cases to really give people an extra clear picture of how it all works, e.g. Alice registers as a lender, Bob takes out the loan and pays it all back, then Charlie takes out a loan but doesn't pay it back, etc., going on to show how the bad debt is covered, how credit worthiness is established and affected.  Hi Styca, that's a wonderful question. Please allow me to paint a clear picture, using your example. If 'Charlie' doesn't pay, the following will occur:  - ~1 day delinquent: email goes out - ~3 day delinquent: email and text message go out - ~7 day delinquent: email and text message and collection calls go out - after ~1 month of no payment: over-collateralization kicks in - after ~2 months of no payment Guarantor gets notified - after ~3 months of no payment: Guarantor gets called upon to provide full balance payment... and if no guarantor then client will get paid from the cross-collateral pool and ultimate reserve pool for overage.  Self serve refinancing option is available to borrowers to avoid delinquencies. The number of times, amounts and terms are presented by the lenders upfront.  Lenders can rate their borrowers at the end of term from 1 to 5 stars with written review. It would be silly for the borrowers to destroy their reputation for future borrowing.  In the future, APIs can be used to connect to our systems so lenders in banks, small firms, etc. can use our well established ratings to determine eligibility their clients. Currently, if you want to borrow from a different bank within the same city, they have different fees/waiting periods because each bank has a different internal record of your credit. We are solving that. That's what I was saying. Really good plan to solve problems. what do you mean when you said delinquent?  A delinquent borrower refers to a borrower that does not pay their loans back on time, or defaults completely.",False

We will be partnering with various credit scoring agents in our ecosystem and we cannot comment on exactly how they calculate their ratings. That being said, credit rating only gets one approved or disapprove and it may affect the interest rate; the amount to be borrowed is purely based on the ability to repay. Therefore, having a history of very small loans and pays them all back does not qualify for a larger loan.  Use case: The owner of a Startup company has the equivalent of credit score more than 630 FICO score. Approved, based the combined (person + business) ability to repay, the maximum borrowing can be $10,000. The credit rating can improve over time and the interest rate may go down accordingly, but the maximum he can borrow is still based on the ability to repay, ie $10,000. There is no need to borrow $3,000 multiple times, the small business can borrow $10,000 right from the start.

Our end goal is for borrowers to borrow from any lender in the world - unlocking the money and increasing the living standards of all. So can I invest wherever am I?  Yes, our phase II is cross-border lending. We want borrowers to access funding worldwide. Can I invest in fiats or only en Ethereum?  In phase II, it will be any currency you like. In phase I, Must we to invest only in Ethereums?  We anticipate in phase I, which is lending money within borders, it will be in both FIAT and crypto.

I suppose that there will be some options.  I'd like to know this as well. Presumably each lender will offer different terms in an open marketplace, and borrowers can choose which to apply for.  Definitely! As a borrower, you can set the parameters that you want to borrow at. That would include loan amount, interest rate, term, etc. I highly recommend trying out our wireframe on our website to see the matching process for yourself. Perfect! I see that the parameters of the loan are flexible. Where can I find your wireframe exactly?  You can find it here! https://www.fintrux.com/demo/login.html Please make an account and try out both the lender and borrower interface for yourself, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any additional questions.",False

One thing I'm still unsure about is how credit enhancement works, and the mechanisms used to prevent exploitation. Please would you be able to help me a bit on this? Say if someone takes out a lot of very small loans and pays them all back, with the aim of establishing a high credit rating... and then uses this high credit rating to obtain a much larger loan which they can then default on. Is the solution that the borrower's rating only increases in proportion to the amount borrowed? So if someone borrows $10 and gets rated 5 their credit rating increases 5x10=50, but if they borrow $100 and get a 5, their rating increases +500 ? I appreciate I'm being over-simplistic.

Please allow me to paint a clear picture, using your example. If 'Charlie' doesn't pay, the following will occur:  - ~1 day delinquent: email goes out - ~3 day delinquent: email and text message go out - ~7 day delinquent: email and text message and collection calls go out - after ~1 month of no payment: over-collateralization kicks in - after ~2 months of no payment Guarantor gets notified - after ~3 months of no payment: Guarantor gets called upon to provide full balance payment... and if no guarantor then client will get paid from the cross-collateral pool and ultimate reserve pool for overage.  Self serve refinancing option is available to borrowers to avoid delinquencies. The number of times, amounts and terms are presented by the lenders upfront.  Lenders can rate their borrowers at the end of term from 1 to 5 stars with written review. It would be silly for the borrowers to destroy their reputation for future borrowing.  In the future, APIs can be used to connect to our systems so lenders in banks, small firms, etc. can use our well established ratings to determine eligibility their clients. Currently, if you want to borrow from a different bank within the same city, they have different fees/waiting periods because each bank has a different internal record of your credit. We are solving that.",False

Some ICOs offer huge initial bonuses, but I think that creates a problem because it just encourages people to dump the coins as soon as they hit the exchange... if you get 100% bonus then you can double your initial outlay simply by selling at ICO price.

View this to see what it means. https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn-canada/whats-isv-faq-microsoft-partners-independent-software-vendors-app-builders/  Hi stopatnever,  There are all kinds of partnerships:  1. A strategic partnership is a relationship between two commercial enterprises, usually formalized by one or more business contracts; 2. A Community partner may be, but is not limited to, the following: local, state, national, international, public, community-based, private and academic organization; 3. A joint venture is a business arrangement in which two or more parties agree to pool their resources for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task. This task can be a new project or any other business activity; 4. A channel partner is a company that partners with a manufacturer or producer to market and sell the manufacturer's products, services, or technologies. This is usually done through a co-branding relationship; 5. R&D Partner is a type of partnership devoted to the research and development of new products and services; 6. etc.  Our partnership with Microsoft is a combination of some of the above. Press release should come out in due course when we have accomplished what we set out to do together in the first place - bringing scalability and security to the Ethereum world via Microsoft product offerings. We are still working on it. Promise to try harder. Thank you for your patience.",False

Hi there! From the way I understand the concept this will depend on a few factors... eg. the terms of the lender, the amount and terms of the loan package, the legal requirements of your locale, and your credit rating at the time of applying for a loan.  As far as personal information, remember that KYC (Know Your Customer), Credit Checks, as well as Identity Verification will all be part of the process. So you will be required to provide personal information similar to what you would for any other loan application.  The difference with the FintruX ecosystem is that you will have lenders competing to instantly match your loan request with an offer, and because of the low fees on the platform, you will get a very low interest rate on your loan compared with traditional financing providers. It looks like a good option to get a loan. Furthermore, the matching with lenders seems to be very fast. Is there a minimum or maximum for the loan?  In our current model, there would a min of ~$3000 US, and max of $300,000 US, spanning over 3-24 months. This is strategically aimed towards SMEs and startups that require cashflow in their first few months/years of business. Yes, this loan fits perfectly with the interest of companies that are starting. But, where I could get the loan? In other words, do I need to be in a specific country to get the loan or wherever ?  Our starting countries will be Canada and Singapore. Our end goal is exactly what you describe, that any borrower can take advantage of our global platform to borrow from lenders anywhere in the world.",False

It looks like a good option to get a loan. Furthermore, the matching with lenders seems to be very fast. Is there a minimum or maximum for the loan?  In our current model, there would a min of ~$3000 US, and max of $300,000 US, spanning over 3-24 months. This is strategically aimed towards SMEs and startups that require cashflow in their first few months/years of business.",False

It is a centralized loans platform for loans amount higher than US$5,000. It uses the smart contract only for depositing crypto currency as collateral. Their target market is borrowers with crypto currencies who don’t want to liquidate into fiat. Only Accredited Investors and qualified financial institutions can become lenders on SALT.  As mentioned previously, we focus on unsecured loans in any currency (fiat, crypto, etc.) We use credit enhancing tools such as over-collateralization, guarantors, cross-collateralization, and 5% of all FTX tokens to neutralize risk for lenders. On top of that, we focus on SMEs (small businesses) and especially startups. It can be difficult for startups to secure funding at the moment because no one is lending to them - not without huge interest rates. We are changing that by offering the simplest loan for the lowest interest rates to these companies that need funding and cashflow without breaking the bank.

A unique smart contract is generated and deployed by FintruX Network for each individual borrowing at real time to provide unambiguous, immutable, and censorship resistant records where no arbitration is required; 3. In addition to simplifying the loan application process via instant matching, FintruX Network also provides borrowers with post-funding self-serve administration options such as refinance and prepayment.  To further enhance our offering, we will make our platform available to partners such as fraud and identity service agents, credit scoring and decision agents, wallets, exchanges, banks, asset managers, insurance companies and technology companies; to offer new investment and borrower products, and develop new tools for use on our platform.

There is no risk involved in our part, since we are not using our own money to lend or to cover loans. We are simply using securitization principles that are generally reserved for large bulk funding and implementing them for all unsecured loans to SMEs, especially startups. We can do this because of our expertise in serving the securitization sector for 20 years, and superior technology in a no-code development platform which allows us to generate an individual program per each contract.  An unsecured loan is a loan that is not protected or secured by any asset. In this case the lender is taking a lot more risk and would likely charge a higher interest rate. The riskier the loan, the more expensive it will be. We are going to change that.  The credit enhancers are as follows: 1. Over-collateralization acting as additional security; and if it fails to cover all losses arising from the same borrower, 2. Third-party guarantors take care of the overflow losses from the above for the selected loans; and if it still fails, 3. Cross-collateralization pool provides additional insurance; and if it still fails, 4. Five (5)% of all FTX Tokens has been reserved to cover any losses incurred by lenders.  In essence, we make borrowing and lending a no brainer for both borrowers and investors. Investors enjoy a very safe low-risk loan for a traditionally high-risk venture, and borrowers benefit from low interest rates that result with low-risk.",False

This is one of the major points that we vary greatly from the competition - Traditional automation is one system for all varieties of transactions – lots of “if-then-else” statements, very complicated.

We generate one unique program (“Smart Contract”) for each borrower contract to be deployed at real-time on the blockchain via a configurable interface. By generating a new contract for each individual use case, each program is in its simplest form, no more if-then-else statements.  This means that all the code is specifically catered for one fully customized event. Smaller programs lead to lower gas fees and faster transactions.

Elixir for one has a good roadmap and user interface in the future  Also, after further reading into their offering, we identified a problem with their structure. If ELIX token appreciates in value, borrowers can never pay it back. Please see the direct quote taken from their website:  “After you borrow your ELIX, you can sell them on exchanges for USD, withdraw that USD, and use the money for whatever you need. When you have the money to pay your friend back, you can buy ELIX and square up.”  This will drive away borrowers UNLESS they are committing to never letting their token appreciate. Does your token solve this problem?  Our token would not have this problem at all. There is nothing to ""square up"", as the borrowers repay their loan in the same currency (fiat or not) that they originally borrowed in.  With exception of the currency being financed, inside the FintruX Network, everything is tokenized. Lenders convert the over-collateralization portion of their funding into FTX Token to be stored in the over/cross collateralization pool.    Agencies, guarantors, and FintruX Network are all being paid in FTX Token.  Rewards and late charges to borrowers are paid in FTX Token as well.  This creates a token economy for the limited supply of FTX Token.",False

In actuality, tokenization for us increases the security of the loan in the form of credit enhancers.  An example is collateralization pools. FintruX Network collects 10% of each loan as over collateralization and injects that into the respective cross-collateralization pools. Each pool is designated by the same credit decision package and in the same currency.   In addition, 5% FTX Token has been reserved to cover credit/default losses as a last resort.  Since it takes time to repay the loan and it is stored in FTX Token, these pools can go up in value when properly invested and managed making this a safe insurance to cover the credit/default risk for the benefits of lenders. Activities and status on each pool will be transparent to respective lenders. Regardless, it will take more than one bad loan out of ten to deplete this insurance pool. There is also a buffering effect as more and more new loans contributing to their respective pools.  You can read all about the power of FTX in this blog post.",False

Please allow me to answer your question in two stages.  We have an edge over the competition because no one else is making unsecured loans secure. Cost reduction is one of the most important motivations in securitization. It is often done via credit enhancement. We can apply the same principals to reduce the interest rate required by unsecured loans, making it attractive to both borrowers and lenders. Our team combined >50 years of experience in the securitization sector enables us to leverage our skills and expertise to effectively apply these concepts to FintruX.  Our goal at FintruX Network is to disrupt the way unsecured loans are being originated and administered. An unsecured loan is a loan that is not protected or secured by any asset. In this case the lender is taking a lot more risk and would likely charge a higher interest rate. The riskier the loan, the more expensive it will be. We are going to change that.  There are options to obtain an unsecured loan for your business. Local banks, private lenders, and marketplace lenders such as peer-to-peer and direct platform lenders. However, there are rooms for improvement in the areas of transparency, risk & rate reduction, and ease & speed of funding. FintruX Network can deliver an experience to address all of these at the same time. At FintruX Network we facilitate marketplace lending in a true peer-to-peer network. Through credit enhancement, we improve credit worthiness. The lender is reassured that the borrower will honor the obligation via additional collateral, insurance, and a third-party guarantor. Credit enhancement reduces credit/default risk of a debt, thereby increasing the overall credit rating and lowering interest rates simultaneously.   Our competitors are platform lenders that lend to small businesses which can be divided into two main categories: 1. Traditional P2P and Direct Lenders - Lending within the same country with the country’s currency (eg. Funding Circle, OnDeck and Kabbage) Overall, all three of these companies seek to address one major structural flaw in the current small business credit environment: banks and other traditional capital sources are not lending to SMB's. That is why more and more business owners are turning to alternative finance to grow their companies.  2. Crypto currency using smart contract - Lending using blockchain smart contract as an intermediary (eg. ETHLend, Lendoit, SALT) Using tokens as a collateral, ETHLend is a fully decentralized peer to peer lending platform using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for lending Ether. ETHLend does not generate score and does not have any compensation funds to protect lenders.  Lendoit is similar to ETHLend but it adds borrower scoring, reputation, collector and 2% from the crowdsale as compensation fund to protect lenders.  SALT lends in fiat currencies. It is a centralized loans platform for loans amount higher than US$5,000. It uses the smart contract only for depositing crypto currency as collateral. Their target market is borrowers with crypto currencies who don’t want to liquidate into fiat. Only Accredited Investors and qualified financial institutions can become lenders on SALT.  Where we differentiate is the following: FintruX Network is a fully decentralized peer to peer platform generating and deploying one unique smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain for each individual lending. For unsecured loans, it uses credit enhancing tools such as over-collateralization, guarantors, cross-collateralization, and 5% of all FTX tokens to neutralize risk for lenders.  Our target borrowers are small businesses, especially startups, who wish to take advantage of lower rates offered by our platform because we make unsecured loans highly secure. Specialized agents on fraud, identity, credit scoring and decisions are partners in this ecosystem. Only accredited investors and financial institutions can become lenders on phase I of FintruX Network.  There are hundreds of marketplace lending platforms out there, we differ in that we enable borrowers to borrow at a significantly lower rate at ease and lenders lend with confidence in no time at all.

It is a centralized loans platform for loans amount higher than US$5,000. It uses the smart contract only for depositing crypto currency as collateral. Their target market is borrowers with crypto currencies who don’t want to liquidate into fiat. Only Accredited Investors and qualified financial institutions can become lenders on SALT.  FintruX Network is a fully decentralized peer to peer platform generating and deploying one unique smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain for each individual lending. For unsecured loans, it uses credit enhancing tools such as over-collateralization, guarantors, cross-collateralization, and 5% of all FTX tokens to neutralize risk for lenders.  Our target borrowers are small businesses, especially startups, who wish to take advantage of lower rates offered by our platform because we make unsecured loans highly secure. Specialized agents on fraud, identity, credit scoring and decisions are partners in this ecosystem. Only accredited investors and financial institutions can become lenders on phase I of FintruX Network.  There are hundreds of marketplace lending platforms out there, we differ in that we enable borrowers to borrow at a significantly lower rate at ease and lenders lend with confidence in no time at all.  The team has pre-determined a minimum goal of 7,000 ETH that represents the runway necessary for the core FintruX platform to be finished and released with minimum functionality. If the minimum goal is not reached by the end of the crowdsale duration, all contributed Ether will be marked for refund. Anyone who contributed, including those who purchased our tokens at presale, will be able to withdraw their Ether from the sale contract.  Hope this answers your questions!",False
