We did explain the $2 million reward is based on our maximum funds raised which is suppose to be 10% of our funds raised. What you are asking is now to give $2 million regardless of the amount we raised, which consist of 30% of the amount of funds raised. How can we provide $2 Million funds raised to a few individuals for a signature campaign?. How will that be fair for contributors who have really invested hundreds and thousands?.  That one individual was being overwhelmingly greedy about asking for $200,000 for a months work?. That is why we banned him for constantly asking for that kind of amount. We have been trying to facilitate the process of going live soonest, and probably have been over-promising on our delivery time. We are still working on getting this done soonest, in the mean time we are still constantly actively updating, and have not gone silent like most other ICO's.  Launching of demo's and MVP's are easy, we are no longer focusing on that as we are focusing on getting a fully working secure exchange out. So please do not compare us to beta's and demo's.

As you are aware, majority ICO's do not actually raise a large number of their funds from the public, most of it is actually done in Private with institutes and private investors. And we are not any different in this aspect.  As an exchange, the priority has always been awareness and exposure on top of raising funds privately. Now your concerns are valid, but if you were to think of it logically, is there a purpose to inflate our amount raised?. The only purpose that may serve is to dupe more people into investing during ICO period, but then it wouldn't make any sense because we are about to go LIVE. We are no longer raising any more funds.  Now ultimately whether we are a scam or not, would have to fall on the product we will be developing. So please look forward to the launch of our exchange.  As mentioned by vicky77  ""Anyway..for a paltry amount this doesn't end up like a scam..when they can genuinely make Huge gains.""  That is absolutely right. We are not like other ICO's. We have been around for nearly a year and we are looking forward to making it big like binance or kucoin. So please be patient with us, and thank you very much for your continuous observation and support!. We will be having a referral system in place as well and remember our coin is a PROOF OF STAKE COIN, and our total and circulating supply is lesser by 5x to 10x compared to other exchanges/ICOs. More info to come when we go live soon!.  Target of $4.5 Million reached!.",False

That way, users can simply pick the longest valid chain with the highest amount of work as the correct chain.  But this implies that Proof of Work is extremely inefficient in term of energy, and therefore also very expensive; which incentivize miners to centralize the hashing power -- obviously not desirable for a network whose goal is to minimize the need to trust third parties.  Proof of Stake isn't about mining, it's about validating. In effect blocks still need to be created by someone, and who gets to create the next block depends on the specific Proof of Stake algorithm, but the selection process must have some kind of randomness, or at least distribute voting shares properly (otherwise we revert to a centralized system).  In PoS, each validator owns some stake in the network, ether in the case of Ethereum, that they bond. Bonding stake means you deposit some money into the network, and in some sense use it as a collateral to vouch for a block. In PoW you know a chain is valid because lots of work is behind it, while in PoS you trust the chain with the highest collateral.  There are important differences between the various Proof of Stake algorithms that are being developed. This question is about PoW vs. PoS so I'm keeping the answer very general. Sauce: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/141   My opinion on this: I really don't know why we had to make all those PoW tokens, it's kind of a wasted energy. PoS works just fine and cannot be hacked or abused since it's on a decentralized blockchain.  1. you don't need a machine to mine 2, owning a POS has 2 simultaneous benefits. - You reduce the circulating supply in the market, increasing the chances of the token price to increase, while passively earning tokens without a mining rig. Also it's more eco friendly since you back your assets by gold, fiat or company shares, and not solving complex math problems.",False

Binance and Kucoin have huge user bases, but it is not enough.  As MySpace was replaced by Facebook, we can expect Binance to be replaced by Bitto.  With a great idea of covering everything needed by users, Bitto will hold a true monopoly because no other exchange will be able to compete with Smart Trading, Signal, Staking, Crytocurrencies Backed Loan (legit - peer to peer SALT like loan), Referral program and of course Exchange services.  Also, Bitto has incredibly low token supply, making it a really good thing to invest in. This Exchange ICO has a total supply of 23.000.000 tokens only, and that’s why I’m confident it can hit 70$ by the end of 2018.  I’m truly excited about this project because it will have so many features in one vendor. Fewer middlemen means lower fee for end user, which translates to many users switching to Bitto services. And to specifically answer this Quora question - that means high profit for early investors.  You can now get huge bonus (up to 65%) on their ICO tokens.  UPDATE: They’re even considering further lowering their total token supply, so price could be higher than predicted at first. Source - saw on their telegram supergroup chat.   More than $1.000.000 worth of tokens already sold - ICO lasts until 3rd of April.  Demo dashboard here: http://demo.bitto.tech/exchange.html#",False

Let me explain - say, you need 5 galleons to buy a new broom and a silver cauldron, but you only have 15 sickles and 4 knuts.  You have 10.000£ but you don't want to sell it because Queen's money makes way more sense than wizarding currency.  Worry not, fellow magical person! With Bitto you can borrow 4 galleons, 1 sickle, and 25 knuts without selling your muggle money.  Once the Ministry of Magic gives you your monthly salary, you can repay your lender, and your £££ are still yours in case you need to pay for electricity bills in muggle world.  You will have to pay 3 sickles and 18 knuts extra to your lender though because there's no magic in world of finance so no one will give you anything for free.""

I was writing about lending in the previous comment. Borrowing is good under couple of circumstances - if you want to hold some of your assets. Let's say you don't want to sell NEO because you know it will recover after a great new year dip, but you need money to pay for your car repair. You borrow money with a good contract (5% per month) and once your NEO rises up, you sell some of it and repay your lender with some interest. That way everyone win (except for the panic sellers and inexpirienced buyers who want to buy NEO from you when its rising lol  BTW I can't wait to see Bitto loan in action because I will be able to borrow to people in my country. When they see familiar name, they will feel confident to do business, and of course the rates will be better than at banks so again everybody win (on the HODL team xD)",False
