The team are thinking of another solution to reward those hunters who did work hard for us and didn't cheat. FinanceX is looking out for investors who have parted ways with significant amounts of money in support for us seeing the potential in our team, product and vision. We will be well established in two countries very soon and have already established a functioning exchange with no issues and a research institute at a leading university in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the solution to the previous bounty campaign hasn't been to everyone's liking but there is still a massive opportunity for hunters to earn from 8.55 million FNX tokens, a token that unlike most other ICO tokens in 2018, will actually have value backed by a team of fintech experts and a quality product, not just an idea. If you are a former bounty hunter that has been banned, please send a private message and we can discuss adding you back to the Telegram group and continuing the bounty if you so choose. If not, we wish you understand that FinanceX has the best interests of our investors in mind and cheating bounty hunters are effectively stealing from them. Looking forward to your response and we will continue to develop our products, report on our progress and make announcements as we move toward the beginning of our ICO together. Thank you.",True

FinanceX has added a new round of Presales changing the dates of the ICO.  In order for FinanceX to reach its full potential and give our investors the highest ROI that they deserve, we believe it is necessary to provide more time.  It also gives our Indonesian investors more time to take advantage of the low Presale price before the impending launch of our Indonesian exchange. The launch of our Indonesian exchange will go ahead as planned!  The new ICO dates are as follows:  Presales continue until November 14 ICO Round 1: November 21 - December 4 ICO Round 2: December 5 - December 19 ICO Round 3: December 20 - December 31 FNX listing date: January 15  With the current state of the market, if FinanceX continued with the planned dates, we wouldn't be providing our investors with the best opportunity for profits.  Good teams make the necessary adjustments to be as successful as possible. FinanceX aims to create the biggest exchange in Southeast Asia and among the top 10 in the Asia-Pacific region within 3 years.  FinanceX sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience that the date change may cause to our community and we are happy to answer any questions that you may have.  Given the state of the market, FinanceX has done exceptionally well to all but reach our Private sale hardcap, and experience a good sale rate during the first Presale stage. Investors are identifying the uniqueness of our product.  Relevent documents will be updated in the next 24 hours.

There are many advantages to using the FinanceX exchange.  1) Fiat-to-coin trading pairs - this allows traders in countries outside of the US easy access to the coins they desire and allows traders to cash-out directly to their local currency without the need for intermediates. 2) Rapid assets transfers - transferring from bank-to-wallet takes less than 3 minutes and from wallet-to-bank less than one hour. Much faster than the competition. 3) Low fees - 0.3% for trading fees and no fees for transferring assets between exchanges 4) Easy-to-use interface - intuative and user friendly interface making trading easy 5) Rapid processing - Our trading core, built off of the trading core of the Hanoi Stock Exchange, can process up to 100,000 transactions per second 6) Interexchange network - we will create a network of exchanges starting in Southeast Asia and expanding. The first was recntly launched in Vietnam and more will be launched before the end of this year in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. 7) Our FNX token - It will boost liquidity on our platform   Most ICO's are pitched on an idea rather than a product. We have a high quality product and we have no trouble listing our token as we have the exchange!!  Thanks for the question.",True

Our first priority is the Southeast Asian market before expanding in to the wider Asia-Pacific region. When starting a cryptoexchange, you can't immediately introduce all fiats because initially you need a platform with high liquidity. Saturating the exchange with every fiat before generating high liquidity could create a platform where no one can get their order matched. The fiats you mentioned are most definitely on our radar in the not so distant future.  Thanks for the question. I hope this helps!",True

Many things!  1) We provide customers with fiat-to-coin trading pairs allowing quick and easy cash-out and enabling traders to bypass BTC if they wish.  2) Low trading fees. It is not uncommon to see trading fees set at 1-2%, yet we only charge 0.3% and there are no hidden fees.  3) We offer transparency. Just as our fees are transparent, we want our team and our vision to be completely transparent. We plan to do this with our growing social media presence.  4) Real-time automatic trading capable of processing up to 100,000 thousand transactions per second. Most exchanges use the OTC model which is less transparent, more risky and much slower.  5) High liquidity. Once established, our platform will offer high liquidity as we set up an interexchange network between Southeast Asian countries. Our FNX token will aid in high liquidity.  6) Rapid processing times. Bank-to-wallet transfers will take less than 3 minutes and wallet-to-bank less than 1 hour. Much faster than competitors.   Hope this helps!!!",True

You may not get the exchange rate you want.  There are a few exchanges that allow you to trade using fiat, but they still have limitations: -   High trading fees (1-2%) -   Poor technology makes the trading process slow with low availability. This prevent you from maximizing your potential profits. -   Low liquidity. Difficult to find a buyer.    2.
