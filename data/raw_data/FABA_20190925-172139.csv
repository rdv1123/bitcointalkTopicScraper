Vuje + Faba teams    Mooyla and Cargo, blockchain segment, yes, these projects are ICOs, so what?  Alex Nakonechny - not a big fan of LinkedIn  Alex is a CTO and co-founder of FABA. His wide professional network of contacts has helped us to get where we are today. From the technical point of view he has been a great support around ICO processes and smart contract issues. And from the personality point of view, Alex is the sweetest guy ever, it is a person the whole team can always rely on and have a full trust.  Robert Flocius, our CEO Robert is in his 50s and with his wide VC experience, building and exiting the companies in all over the world, it would be surprising if he would not have other responsibilities as well. We are very grateful for his 70% engagement in FABA. He joined the team simply because of the same chemistry w/o any promises. In fact the guy like him does not need any promises anymore. In the FABA team we all have the same aim, to help this world become a better place and it does not really matter if someone with so much hate, believe it or not.  Why Blockchain? We wanted to open up Ventura capital to ordinary people, where the investment is possible from 200 USD. As well get inspired by crypto community when deciding on our investments.  Return on investment If someone has at least a little knowledge how the Venture capital works, it is a general statistic that up to 60% of average VC portfolio companies will fail with ROI lower than 1 and the remaining companies will generate ROI between 3 to 5.  Smart contract FABA announced the deployment of a new smart contract on the 20th of January 2019. This change became necessary following the bug that affected a lot of ERC20 smart contracts on the 11th of January 2019. FABA smart contract was also affected because we were sending out bulk airdrop tokens to our airdrop participants when the bug exploit occurred on the ethereum blockchain network, and this bug exploit was reported by a lot of ICO teams at the said time of the error. Article link: https://steemit.com/new/@fabainvest/new-smart-contract-deployed   It is so sad how much hate and negativity can be in one person. To put all this together must have taken lots of precious time and effort. Crypto world has many positive sites, but unfortunately as well negative ones. This is a perfect example how negative energy can destroy the motivation. But hey, what does not kill us, will makes us only stronger!  Your FABA team",False

His wide professional network of contacts has helped us to get where we are today. From the technical point of view he has been a great support around ICO processes and smart contract issues. And from the personality point of view, Alex is the sweetest guy ever, it is a person the whole team can always rely on and have a full trust.  Robert Flocius, our CEO Robert is in his 50s and with his wide VC experience, building and exiting the companies in all over the world, it would be surprising if he would not have other responsibilities as well. We are very grateful for his 70% engagement in FABA. He joined the team simply because of the same chemistry w/o any promises. In fact the guy like him does not need any promises anymore. In the FABA team we all have the same aim, to help this world become a better place and it does not really matter if someone with so much hate, believe it or not.  Why Blockchain? We wanted to open up Ventura capital to ordinary people, where the investment is possible from 200 USD. As well get inspired by crypto community when deciding on our investments.  Return on investment If someone has at least a little knowledge how the Venture capital works, it is a general statistic that up to 60% of average VC portfolio companies will fail with ROI lower than 1 and the remaining companies will generate ROI between 3 to 5.  Smart contract FABA announced the deployment of a new smart contract on the 20th of January 2019. This change became necessary following the bug that affected a lot of ERC20 smart contracts on the 11th of January 2019. FABA smart contract was also affected because we were sending out bulk airdrop tokens to our airdrop participants when the bug exploit occurred on the ethereum blockchain network, and this bug exploit was reported by a lot of ICO teams at the said time of the error. Article link: https://steemit.com/new/@fabainvest/new-smart-contract-deployed   It is so sad how much hate and negativity can be in one person. To put all this together must have taken lots of precious time and effort. Crypto world has many positive sites, but unfortunately as well negative ones. This is a perfect example how negative energy can destroy the motivation. But hey, what does not kill us, will makes us only stronger!  Your FABA team",False

Hooba Foods, is a UK company that uses substitute for meat oyster mushroom. Hoouba Foods is one of our favourite project as we are very well aware of meat industry impact on our planet:  - Waste From a Farm of 2,500 Dairy Cows is Equivalent to a City of 411,000 People. - Every Minute, 3.2 Million Kilograms of Excrement are Produced by Animals in the US. - A Person on a Vegan Diet for 1 Year Needs 674 M²; a Vegetarian Needs 3x that Amount; And a Meat Eater Requires 18x that Amount! - Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Livestock is 51% Versus 13% for All Other Transportation - 1 Hamburger = 3,000 Liters of Water = 2 Months of Showering - 105 Billion M² of Rainforest Cleared for Palm Oil Production Versus 550 Billion M² for Animal Agriculture  Some members of FABA core team are vegetarian, we love Hooba Foods project and mostly the taste!!  Social impact of Hooba Foods:  https://hoobafoods.com/pages/social-impact  Hooba foods is working with a number of partners to grow mushrooms using waste used coffee grounds (that would normally go to landfill) in unused urban spaces and prisons. Our partners collect the coffee grounds locally, we supply the mushroom spawn, and the growing happens under Newcastle Central Station in an area kindly provided by Virgin Trains East Coast, and at HM Prison Kirklevington in recycled shipping containers. Stated by the Hooba team.   For Long life Inc.  US Company For Long Life inc. has very interesting all natural based products in its porfolio. FABA is funding the product called DIALESS - Dietary supplement for diabetics with immediate effect. The ""white mafia"" is ruling the world today, which claims to heal human lives, but unfortunately does not cure. It's a big business with human lives, insulin has never healed any sick person suffering from diabetes. There are over 400 million people suffering worldwide from diabetes, every year 4.5 million people die of this disease. Dialess works as a prevention and in a larger doses can fully cure this disease. Our aim is to get this product on the market as medicine.  My Father`s Hair.  Czech company My Fathers Hair s.r.o. is a producer of the hair tincture based on the old family receipt tradition, where the main ingredient is the stinging nettle. This tincture helps to cure the hair loss. Stinging nettle is a miracle plant and is used widely in alternative medicine. „If people would be aware of all positive medical effects that nettle has, they would not be growing anything else “. On 4th of February 2019 Project My Father’s hair got approval for dotation from European union structural and investment funds.  Vuje a.s.  Slovak company Vuje is well known Nucleus energetics research center in Europe. Together with Vuje, FABA believes in hydrogen technology and hydrogen cars. Water as a resource will always be available, it represents a closed cycle, the exhaust of such a car is the steam which does not pollute our air. By supporting the hydrogen reactor, we are writing the history of the mankind. This project is the biggest we have in our current portfolio. Vuje + Faba teams     Mooyla and Cargo, blockchain segment, yes, these projects are ICOs, so what?  Alex Nakonechny - not a big fan of LinkedIn  Alex is a CTO and co-founder of FABA. His wide professional network of contacts has helped us to get where we are today. From the technical point of view he has been a great support around ICO processes and smart contract issues. And from the personality point of view, Alex is the sweetest guy ever, it is a person the whole team can always rely on and have a full trust.  Robert Flocius, our CEO Robert is in his 50s and with his wide VC experience, building and exiting the companies in all over the world, it would be surprising if he would not have other responsibilities as well. We are very grateful for his 70% engagement in FABA. He joined the team simply because of the same chemistry w/o any promises. In fact the guy like him does not need any promises anymore. In the FABA team we all have the same aim, to help this world become a better place and it does not really matter if someone with so much hate, believe it or not.  Why Blockchain? We wanted to open up Ventura capital to ordinary people, where the investment is possible from 200 USD. As well get inspired by crypto community when deciding on our investments.  Return on investment If someone has at least a little knowledge how the Venture capital works, it is a general statistic that up to 60% of average VC portfolio companies will fail with ROI lower than 1 and the remaining companies will generate ROI between 3 to 5.  Smart contract FABA announced the deployment of a new smart contract on the 20th of January 2019. This change became necessary following the bug that affected a lot of ERC20 smart contracts on the 11th of January 2019. FABA smart contract was also affected because we were sending out bulk airdrop tokens to our airdrop participants when the bug exploit occurred on the ethereum blockchain network, and this bug exploit was reported by a lot of ICO teams at the said time of the error. Article link: https://steemit.com/new/@fabainvest/new-smart-contract-deployed   It is so sad how much hate and negativity can be in one person. To put all this together must have taken lots of precious time and effort. Crypto world has many positive sites, but unfortunately as well negative ones. This is a perfect example how negative energy can destroy the motivation. But hey, what does not kill us, will makes us only stronger!  Your FABA team",False

All possible tools used: Google maps, British lawyers and cheeky Instagram.     Did we already explain why you shouldn’t believe a cryptocurrency startup just because they called themselves an STO? Oh, right, we did when told you about Bolton Coin. By the way, those guys took our article very negatively and demand to remove it. Of course, we won’t do it. After all, they can’t even explain why they are an STO that recognizes SEC. And what is their difference from the common scam ICO?    Well, fuck them. There’re other adventurers on today’s agenda, Faba Invest. For those who are too lazy to read the article in full, we responsibly declare: these startupers are flunkeys who were too lazy to make their fake more or less attractive. Whitepaper is on the level of the student’s presentation, an idiotic idea, there is no need for a Blockchain, but they want to collect 67.5 million bucks. But we will try to enlighten the cryptocats so they won’t give them a cent.     The idea of Faba is to create a collective venture fund. Kind of, we chip in Ethereum and buy Faba tokens. And the founders of the project withdrawal ETH in Fiat and invest in other startups.    In which startups they invest decide all major owners of Faba tokens. 40% of all tokens are in the hands of team members. That is why the story with voting doesn’t look legit. Here are the expectations:    And here is the reality. At the moment, the guys assure that they have invested in six projects:    Two of them are ICO, the third sells Nutra, the fourth – shrooms, the fifth – medication for baldness, the sixth produces hydrogen and renewable resources. The amount of investment is unknown. But it is unlikely large. After all, the next Faba sale will begin on March 1 and the founders have no fucking idea how much money they will collect. Otherwise, they wouldn’t write Soft Cap of 4 million bucks. By the way, how do you like the abyss in 63.5 million between goals? These shitinvestors are so experienced strategists that they are trying to shot in the dark.     The expected profit for the owners of security Faba tokens is also different. But it is very optimistic:    It is so fun to look at the expectations of investing in the future unicorn. Just imagine a picture of how joyful Satoshi and Buterin are riding a rainbow 🙂    Faba Invest doesn’t undertake any obligations to investors. The USA and China are out of the list of potential lucky investors. Legally the company is located in London.      In addition to Faba Invest and Unique Casino, there are 270 companies registered in this building. I wonder how they all fit in there?    In the UK, Faba is registered by Connexion Capital. And, most recently. Just in time for the sale.    The website of Connexion Capital is registered in Sweden for a US company.    And Faba is Czech or Swiss.      But, most likely, the Czechs. At least, the company’s mentor with the name of a pornstar is from here.    Here is her Instagram. Will be useful in case of insomnia.        It would be cool if she will answer the questions of Icobench experts because the CTO of Faba Invest Alexander Nakonechny is unable to cope with this task.    What can you do? Judging by LinkedIn, the guy didn’t work anywhere before Faba. He was an independent business advisor.      The project’s CEO is Robert Fiocius. In addition to Faba, he works at Boston Capital Services (not to be confused with Boston Capital – these are different companies) and DIC Development. Therefore, we can assume that he is just a waxwork. They invited him to the project for the money in exchange for showing up at the right places. But it doesn’t look that cool. You have a startup for over 60 million bucks, and your CEO has two more jobs.  But there is no MVP, and he won’t appear in the near future.    The recent Airdrop made Telegram chat quite popular.    Summarizing all the above:  – Faba invest 100% does not meet SEC requirements for STO – Experience and skills of team members are questionable – The blockchain is only needed here to raise funds during the sale – Registration, geographical and other company info in various sources differ – The business concept of the project doesn’t base on anything, as well as the expected profit for investors.    Dear cryptocats, write in the comments what you think about Faba Invest and our investigation. Together we will win.  By subscribing to our newsletter you confirm that you cannot be fooled by shitty startups, but you knew that, didn’t you?  In Blockchain we trust!",False

Indeed, you still have the next few months to run the ICO, but I doubt the $67 million hardcap can be achieved. If hardcap is not reached, will you continue this project?  That 67 million dollar is the hard cap and I don't think it can be reached. For running the project, soft cap is enough.  Soft cap is more than enough to run a project.
