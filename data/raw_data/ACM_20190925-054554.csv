In this project we are focus 100% on mining Bitcoin, with our ASIC AM-12 on SHA-256 algorithm. Technicaly you can mine any coin based on SHA-256, but we all understand that main profit comes from Bitcoin. So only with ASIC AM-12 and only with Bitcoin Mining we estimate our token growth 438%.   Quote from: P3 on April 28, 2018, 08:41:27 PM quite an interesting project, but I have a question: when investing, I will get your miner or you will have your own pool, and I will buy power in it? After ICO will be finished you will receive ACM Token. Then you make your own decision whether to buy ASIC AM-12 or Hash from our cloud platform. You allow to buy ASIC AM-12 for 1000 ACM token or buy hash from cloud platform or just keep token. We expecting Token growth about 438% per Year. ASIC or hash power will make profit from 350% -450% per Year depending on mining difficulty.   Quote from: rog1121 on April 28, 2018, 08:19:09 PM is the project planned to redeem tokens back? This project does not plan to redeem tokens back, but it gives investors the opportunity to decide what to do with tokens: 1. Leave the tokens to yourself and sell it on crypto exchanges. 2. Buy ACM-12 ASIC for 1000 ACM tokens. 3. Buy Hash from Advanced Miners Platform.  We do not know how much Token will cost, but we can predict how much the investor would make from ASIC AM-12 if they chose to buy ASIC or Hash. ROI now are between 380% - 450% per Year. And it's easy to verify in https://www.cryptocompare.com/  Information about last month profit we add to our onepages:  https://advancedminers.io/storage/app/media/whitepages/onepagesen.pdf",True

Mining investment are long-term investment and long-term investors' benefit from the unique opportunities offered by the most promising market we have ever seen.      However, investments into mining cryptocurrencies require specific knowledge, such as what mining equipment you need to buy and where. We have only several ASIC developers and it is very hard to buy ASIC, particularly of new generation.      Most ASIC miners already on Market for 2-3 years and will not give you sufficient benefits if you buy them now. That is why most of the people miss tremendous opportunities offered by booming mining market.      This was before Advanced Miners introduced their ICO with ASIC of new generation based on 12 nm chip.  ABOUT ADVANCED MINERS PROJECT      OUR MISSION IS TO MAKE BITCOIN MORE DECENTRALISED WITH MORE NEW POOLS AND VARIOUS MINING HARDWARE.      Advanced Miners company was founded in Hong Kong in 2016 with several mining farms in North China. Company developed ASIC AM-12, based on 12nm chip. Now Advanced Miners offers you to become part of Advanced Miners family by buying their ACM Tokens.     OWN ASIC THAT COSTS 1000 ACM TOKENS WITH 28 000 GH/S ON SHA-256 ALGORITHM     Own mining hardware and infrastructure and cheapest electricity in China and Canada are main benefits of Advanced Miners company. With these advantages you'll find incredible opportunities in mining business in 2018-2019 year.   ADVANCED MINERS ONLINE PLATFORM      ADVANCED MINERS ALREADY DEVELOPED AND TESTED ONLINE SELL-BUY HASH PLATFORM, ALSO THEY ANNOUNCED THAT CLOUD MINING PLATFORM WILL BE FINISHED AFTER THE ICO COMPLETION.      Platform is unique, moreover investors can exchange or turn ACM tokens into Hash power. Due to that mining profit and all payments will be effected automatically. You can purchase contracts for Bitcoin mining with ASIC AM-12 and AM-7 with ACM tokens only during all 2018-2019 period. Simplicity and easy-to-use private cabinet will allow to those who never did cryptocurrency mining before to start their profitable work with us without building an own mining farm. Online platform permits to get Bitcoin mining profit in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero and Dash.       ICO investors will have some advantages comparing to other mining companies, so far as they can choose whether to buy ASIC with delivery to their Data centers or buy Hash on online platform with guaranteed cheap electricity, and just start making good money.

First your project seems perfect no doubt. I read your company started in 2016 and you are already producing ASIC for mining. First I knew China banned miners how can you do it without warning from government in China? Then where  can I order your product for mining? You have these products right so I should be able to order it.  Please answer my questions.,True

First China didn't  ban miners. China banned ICO, that's the difference, and we registered in Hong Kong where we do not have any ban and  ICO is allowed.  All big mining companies including Bitmain are still in China. If you order ASIC from Bitmain then you track it going fro China. But despite that Miners are all ok in China, we're planning to open new farms in Canada this year. We will not sell our product on public at least for the first year, instead of that we will distribute our miners between our Investors. So if you want to order our miner, please contribute to our project in 3 days amount that is  equivalent to 1000ACM Token.",True
