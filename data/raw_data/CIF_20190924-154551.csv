What started off as a project to implement sentinel and fix outstanding issues with the CIF Masternode technology turned into a rather exhaustive project which included an upgrade of our current core release, several software and bug fixes as well as several pragmatic alterations in our core blockchain architecture. We are in the final stages of this extensive project and are in the process of testing our new nodes to ensure core logic is not corrupted with our custom build.  We realize that we experienced some downtime in the last week (the chain was not moving forward) due to the fact that current pools were experiencing difficulty when mining CIF due to a bug in our DGW implementation. Since we we were so close to releasing our masternode update we decided to incorporate several fixes into our nodes to facilitate one all-inclusive release. This will take care of all outstanding issues; provide a more competitive and attractive blockchain as well as implement MN updates, fixes and usability.  We are in the final stages of this update and after successfully progressing the chain with the new nodes, will compile all wallet versions for the community to update. Although everyone is extremely excited and anxious, we propose that these fixes will be done completed and new nodes rolled my end of next week (optimistically earlier). This will be a mandatory update, however all blocks prior to this update will still be valid.  Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns regarding the update.

The Crypto Improvement Fund has expanded its mandate to incorporate a more in-depth educational piece into its initial product offering. Due to the significant lack of educational resources in this space, it was deemed that this project was a respectful use of our resources and industry expertise, and served a valid public purpose, all while generating additional revenue and purpose for the Crypto Improvement Fund project.

These courses and video content will be expanded on and added to monthly, constantly updating our clients with new content and information. Our education products will continue to expand as we add on more course topics and modules. Education is a cornerstone of the CIF project and Blockchain.Edu will be updated with new content as the CIF project continues to evolve. Although blockchain and cryptocurrency basics will be offered to businesses free of charge, additional courses will be created and delivered which will be revenue generating for CIF. All educational products and services may also be purchased with CIF coins. We will be welcoming community participation and custom author contribution to Blockchain.Edu.

However to make a long answer short - since there was a miner script put out that allows miners to work around paying out masternodes as well as a malicious exploit found that propagates network forking, there is no current release date. We've spoken to the devs at Terracoin who are working on a fix and we will most likely be working off the fix that they implement however for the foreseeable there will be no alterations to the coin as enforcing payments just causes unnecessary risk.  Right now the main business objective will be to get our Blockchain.Edu educational centre up and running. Any perks and additions to the coin (including masternodes) outside of the primary market to which we will be building, are ancillary - especially if the tech is not 100%.",False

There are no Phase 3 coins going to the old wallets. Pay out for Phase 3 is 20/01.  For those with Phase 1, 2 or Airdrop coins then theyll be doing the swap on 10/01 AGW - theyre setting us a Discord tool to basically automate it.  Those on the Bounty Campaign need to check and ensure theyve updated with the latest wallets and sent that new wallet address to $CIF.  So in summary - if you dont have the old wallet no worries, just use the new one. If you have the old wallet then download the new one and if you have coins then follow the swap advice that should be with us tomorrow.

If you know what to do, here is the cif.conf file that should get you back on track again ♥   Quote from: wancho on September 15, 2017, 01:15:01 AM Newbie or noob question, It says my wallet is out sync. How to make it sync? Thanks, I'm just a newbie   Hello guys, as you've might have noticed some of us cannot fully synchronize the newly released CIF Wallet (the one that supports masternodes, so not the old wallet with the old gray logo).  The reason why some cannot connect almost certainly is due to the fact that we are not actively trading yet, so we don't have 100s of wallets online to synchronize off of each other. Some wallets just remain in a blind spot..   For people that have trouble connecting or synchronising the new CIF wallet, please edit cif.conf and add nodes. You can doubleclick the file and open it with Windows' Notepad... You will have to create this should it not exist: %AppData%\CIF\cif.conf  Contents of this file: Code: addnode=66.110.245.44 addnode=209.250.243.131 addnode=94.62.208.113 addnode=174.138.22.6 addnode=31.220.60.15 addnode=46.147.193.168 addnode=185.51.187.161 addnode=100.11.237.78 addnode=195.3.157.53 addnode=195.3.157.53 addnode=31.220.60.15 addnode=95.139.249.172 addnode=76.169.57.92 addnode=174.138.22.6 addnode=76.169.57.92 TIP: if you are having problems with the OLD wallet and blockchain... Create above file as: %AppData%\crptoimprovementfund\cryptoimprovementfund.conf  Quote from: CIF on December 31, 2017, 02:17:23 PM Also - just a side note, it's easier to add nodes now!!

Some wallets just remain in a blind spot..   For people that have trouble connecting or synchronising the new CIF wallet, please edit cif.conf and add nodes.

Because the blockchain isn't owned by any one person, so people can technically do whatever they want when a chain is live.

Let me explain this - so we had a price guide on the front page of the website - this was to give people an idea of how many tokens they would receive. This was confusing so we actually took it down as it's not accurate.  This is how tokens will be allocated - currently there are 10m tokens available to purchase. If 2 people put 1 BTC in each, they would each get 5M tokens. If 4 people put 1 BTC in each, they would each get 2.5M tokens. Therefore the number of tokens allocated is entirely based on how much you put in vs. the pot.  Now - you may ask - well I want to know exactly how many tokens i'll be receiving. The answer is - it doesn't matter! Let me explain... If you there's a huge amount contributed to the pot each person will get less tokens (since they're divided up amongst more people) however the listing price will be higher (since the total value of the pot is increased). Therefore the less coins you receive - the more each one of them is worth. This will be translated into the listing when we go live during January - we chose to do this so we wouldn't have to burn coins, it increases our liquidity and... it's a carbon copy of what EOS is doing (which worked very well for them).    How to buy Clicking on the ""Purchase CIF"" link on the website brings up a screen that requires me to provide CIF Wallet address, email address and BTC contribution. I guess I'll need to download the CIF wallet and provide the address. Can I pay using ETH or USD?  So you're on the right track.  You do need to download a CIF wallet to generate an address. You need to pick the amount you'd like to contribute (pick the BTC equivalent) and then once you proceed to the next page you can choose to pay with any Altcoin, ETH, ETH Token or BTC.",False

Q1: How much is raised in the first phase of the ICO?  2.95138071 BTC was raised - 29513.44 USD - 38200.32 CAD 8:04 EST 29/11/2017  Q2: In this forum there has been spoken by the CIF team about VC funding, but there is nothing about it in the whitepaper? Where do the tokens come from which they are buying?  So the VC funding came into play when we realized the opportunity that presented itself in the public markets - working with Duane and Joseph we are extremely close to a deal with will see a significant amount of capital raised and a public listing on the TSXV. This came into play post whitepaper and is more properly represented in the pitch deck and business plan - as seen on https://www.cryptoimprovementfund.io/investors/  Q3: In the whitepaper you can read that the CIf token will be tradable after the first ICO phase, since the first ICO phase is over, why is there no exchange listing yet? Due to the sentiment relayed by the community that it would be a bad idea to list CIF before the ICO was complete - we chose to hold off. However the Escrow agreement does dictate that we must list before any of the raised funds are released from the multisig wallet so buyers still have that protection in place. We didn't want what was happening to several other coins that listed pre-ico completion, to occur.  One thing that is a sign of a strong business is the ability to adapt and change. I can say with confidence that no successful business is 100% to the tune of what they initially drafted on paper x years ago. Very appreciative that you took the time to read through the whitepaper - if you read through our website and our medium where we post alot of activity - our path will make more sense and you'll see where we've started and where we hope we'll end up!  Thanks again for the thoughtful question.  CIF",False

Seriously though when I saw the announcement I went straight to google and he sure has fingers in pies, a good man to have on board by all accounts and this award just reaffirms it! I see he has a habit of literally striking gold so fingers crossed that his association with $CIF is as fruitful!  The VC contingent who are circling $CIF really give another pillar of strength and statement of intent. If I understand correctly, their involvement alone could make $CIF one of the most successful ICOs in recent times. I dont have any concerns on their impact on the $CIF distributed either. If you had gone to exchanges after Round 1 per the plan, and the perception was that whales were coming in and scooping up the lot it would be far more precarious. This way when you go to the exchange youll have completed the ICO phases AND taken on some real corporate weight and that can only give you great momentum going forwards, not to mention the doors that people like Mr Parnham will open.

Usually when a company is pre-revenue (as we are), the idea of going public makes the project more attractive for potential investors. The raise ($5+ million) usually coincides with a companies listing on a stock exchange. Warrants (discounted stock) are issued to entice buyers to purchase the stock at a discounted price, offering an influx of cash for the corporate entity to use right away. If this sounds familiar... it should. An ICO borrows many of the same concepts found in IPO's undertaken by public companies.  That being said - a good pitch deck is always required when sourcing funding. These pitch decks are sent to thousands of security, VC and family office firms. Since we hope the entire community here wants to grow with us - take a look at ours!  Feel free to critique or offer insight. Hopefully this will help you understand our project a bit more. Keep in mind these pitch decks are focused on securing funding, so they may not be as technical as a whitepaper!  Money comes in all shapes and sizes and these are meant for investors who don't want to know everything about an industry - only how they can make money and mitigate risk. Hopefully this provides everyone with a little bit of insight into how startup funding and capital markets work. This doesn't even skim the surface but it does help you understand what we're trying to do.  CIF Pitch Deck  CIF Investor Relations Page",False

Lawyers are very cautious obviously  But there was a rep there from the government who was actually pushing innovation + blockchain  There were more issues around companies that act as investment vehicles as well as exchanges.   so cif sits well?   Yes definitely - one of the main benefits we have is that the primary source of our revenue - as per the business plan we listed on our site - will not be from the ICO.  But we are developing actual products which will generate revenue  The main issue with ICO's and why there's so much concern regarding securities and regulatory concerns is that the ICO is the only revenue generating item in the business plan.  This is problematic  We - fortunately, because I know what we need to do to be truly successful - do not have this problem.  A lot of the discussion was emulating what I've been saying from the beginning though. A lot of crypto are people that don't understand business and a lot of businesses don't understand crypto. It's hard to bridge the two worlds  And that for crypto to be successful - this has to start happening (including the people involved with the projects). A group of software developers don't really understand capital markets, finance or marketing and hedgefunds don't get crypto or blockchain.  There's a divide we plan to bridge with CIF Ltd.   Back to the conference - sounds like a great and much needed event. The only way to bridge these gaps is to communicate and find a common ground and work towards each other - just like train tracks across a country. The more I see and hear and learn about this crypto world the better $CIF sounds and the better the noises coming from $CIF! What @CIF_Admin says about so many ICOs having no revenue generator after their ICO is so true! I'm looking at many trying to get more familiar with this space and loads (most) seem to offer things like payment solutions which is great and needed but so many others offer the same, it's hard to find the unique selling point of these guys! Personally if I'm going to back someone I want to see a tangible source of revenue and growth, and ask myself are these people o would want to work with? Would I use their services? Is there a real world need for this? The answer to all of those for $CIF is a nice big YES!",False

For staking, however, you need to have your wallet open etc. You create a staking weight which influences the time until you get paid. The longer you stake, the higher your stake weight will become, and the shorter the waiting time to get paid. This can take a couple of days, hours, or a week. All depending on how many coins you have.  Regarding the wallet. Honestly, i have seen many projects and wallets.

So... Let me start with an edited copy paste from: https://freedomnode.com/guides/14/how-to-backup-and-restore-bitcoin-wallet  --------> A wallet backup protects your $CIF conis against computer or software failure. It may also help you retrieve your funds after your device was stolen or lost.  There are generally 3 ways to backup the cryptoimprovementfund wallet. Different software supports different methods. We only discuss one - to keep it simple'ish : )  Make sure you're familiar with your wallet before loading it with CIF.  If you lose the backup and can't access your wallet for some reasons, your CIFs are permanently gone!  Remember: Always encrypt your wallet with a strong password to make it more difficult for an attacker to steal your coins!  The method discussed here is used by the Cryptoimprovementfund CIF wallet (and few others like Bitcoin) and comprises of backing up your wallet.dat file. It's a file that holds keys to spend outputs, addresses, transaction information, and other metadata such as contacts.  It has a different location based on the computer operating system you use.  Windows: %AppData%\cryptoimprovementfund Linux: ~/.cryptoimprovementfund/ Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/cryptoimprovementfund/  If you can't find the location please let us know here on bitcointalk, we'll try to assist you.  Installing the Software Download the zip file. Extract it to a new folder. Place the new folder on a place that makes sense (other than the download folder that is). Start the executable in the folder with the extracted file. At first run, a new empty wallet.dat will be created (if it does not exist). If you get an error, start the wallet a second time. Within an hour you should start synchronizing.  Backup Locate your wallet.dat file (see above) and copy it to another device only you have access to. Make sure to leave instructions in your will & testament... ;-(  The 'device' used may be a USB drive, a CD, another computer or your private (!) home cloud storage. Even a not often used online email account with a secure password works great. With (e.g.) Gmail you can easily find back the email and wallet.dat if you send an email to yourself with the text ""backup recovery wallet wallet.dat cif $cif bitcoin altcoin coin coins has:attachment"".  You may also copy it to a cloud storage such as Mega or Dropbox but make sure it's encrypted there with a strong password. Anyone that gets access to the unencrypted file wallet.dat will be able to steal your coins IF you didn't set a password on the wallet.dat. We'll discuss protecting your wallet.dat with a password later.  Note: If you use the cryptoimprovementfund wallet, make sure to backup the wallet.dat file regularly after every ~100 transactions. This way you make sure you have backup of all wallet and change addresses. In case of wallet corruption, you have a copy to go back to. Note: The wallet has a built-in backup option via File-menu. You can choose the folder and the file name of your backup. The wallet does not offer a restore option. For that, you'll have to work manually with explorer and overwriting an empty wallet.dat with your backup.  Restore To restore the backup, simply copy your backed up wallet.dat over an existing one in the cryptoimprovementfund data location (on Windows: %AppData%\cryptoimprovementfund). Just make sure your existing one is empty...! <--------  Some extra newbie information, assuming you are on Windows...  How to get to %AppData%? %AppData%\cryptoimprovementfund is a shortcut notation for the folder C:\Users\YourWindowsUserName\AppData\Roaming\cyrptoimprovementfund. There you will find the blockchain files and most importantly, the file wallet.dat which contains your wallet addresses, your private keys & your $CIF coins! If no wallet.dat exists, the CIF wallet will create one for you when you first start the wallet. If you are 100% certain that your wallet.dat does not contain any coins, you can safely replace it with your backup of wallet.dat - just make sure you close the CIF wallet first...! If your explorer (you know, the yellow binder icon you use to browse to your folders with documents and downloads) does not have an address bar at the top, you can click your way to this folder and the wallet.dat. Just start with Computer, then double click your C:-drive, the Users folder, your User's name and finally to AppData and Roaming. For the last 2 to be visible, you need to tell explorer to show hidden files and folders. If your explorer does have an address bar, you can save yourself some time by just going to %AppData%\Cryptoimprovementfund.   How to encrypt your wallet?  It's so simple, you won't believe it! : ) Start the CIF wallet. Click on Settings. Click on the option Encrypt Wallet. Type your password twice. Be sure it cannot get lost. No password == no access to your $CIF coins! WARNING: ONCE YOUR WALLET IS ENCRYPTED, ALL BACKUPS ARE INVALID AND CANNOT BE USED ANY LONGER! SO: new password? You MUST make a NEW backup! Your old wallet.dat backups will not work any longer. Seriously. It won't ;p   How to stake with your wallet? 1. you have no password on your wallet.dat (so no encryption). Start the wallet and wait for the stakes to come, Coins will mature even when the wallet is offline but for staking to happen, you'll need to have the wallet open and running (PoS works through the blockchain and the blockchain can't give you coins if you're not there to receive them). 2. you have a password on your wallet.dat (so your wallet is encrypted). Start the wallet. Click the Settings menu and choose Unlock Wallet. Staking (PoS) will only happen with an unlocked wallet only. If you have the CIF wallet running but don't unlock it with your password, you will earn no interest / stake / PoS / bonus $CIF coins!",False

We actually have been speaking with a few upcoming exchanges as we personally love the idea of supporting other crypto startups (it really speaks to our corporate ideology). The initial plan was just to release an updated wallet - for current holders however a new product offering (as you described above) would not be off the table.  One thing that is important is to focus on one thing at a time - so we want to successfully complete this ICO and raise significant capital (through a variety of means).

We'll be sending an announcement soon on the decision. We looked at the more recent example of COEVAL and realized that listing too soon could be detrimental to value of CIF and the ICO in general.  That being said - our Escrow Agreement still stands and states that we will not use any funds from the ICO until CIF is listed on an exchange. We put this into play as a way to ensure investors that they would have the ability to sell CIF before we used any ICO funds for our project.  Hope that answers any questions!

I've had a good read of your website and as much of the social media as I can take on which has been plentiful! Great for a total noob like me! I think there is a real niche...if not need...for a business like yours which can help with the adoption of crypto and their associated chains.

The business scope for CIF must be huge!  I have some questions which will probably show the noob-ness you're dealing with here, and sorry if already answered elsewhere(!), but first off the PoS on the $CIF: I understand that the coins have to have been in the wallet, and the wallet online, for 30 days before they mature and start to accrue interest. I understand that this gives the cryprocurrency stability and holdings can help growth but what isn't clear is the 30 days that the wallet is to be online for - is that 30 consecutive days none stop or accumulative (12hrs a day for 60 days, for example)?  I think I read that all the coins had been pre-mined and that they'd all be distributed in the three stages of the ICO, if so then do future transactions on the Blockchain create another coin or will those coins be like a reissue/asset sale? Is this where any $CIF accrued by interest (PoS) and earnings (PoW) come from?

So - as our project does require some funding we are looking towards 500 BTC as a minimum. Our project can scale based on the level of contribution however 500 BTC would be comfortable to achieve what we'd like to do. There is no limit per period as the total BTC will be counted over the entirety of the ICO.  Secondly You asked how we pinned a value to CIF  Well - we took a conservative evaluation of $CIF if we hit the 500 BTC target. This allows individuals a better sense of what they'll be receiving once the ICO term is completed and what they can expect CIF to trade at once we release it onto exchanges.  There are two possible outcomes when forecasting a price - either we come in at less than 500 BTC (not ideal) and each individual gets more $CIF per $1 contributed, or we come in a higher than 500 BTC and each CIF that each individual has is now worth more. What we're doing is similar to the forecasting of short run performance of initial public offerings - it's a very common practice when dictating value of a future priced asset.  These are all great questions and I hope that clears some stuff up for you.",False

There is no possible way the coin can yield a 12% return given a 30-day maturation.  This current setup is detrimental to the coin and incentivizes people to keep their wallets shut down.  This does not help the CIF network.  If I deposit 10K CIF in my wallet on Nov 1, it won't start staking until Nov 30.  If it stakes 30-days later I get 100 CIF and then I have to wait another 30 days for it to  mature again.  That means I get 100 CIF in 90 days.  If I deposit the coins and then shut the wallet down and open it a year later, I get the full 12%.  If someone stakes more often than 30 days they are screwed.    I think CIF has merit, but the reward for being a CIF holder isn't that great under the current setup.  The potential exists for the coins to be maturing for more time than they actually stake.   You will need to raise the interest rate or lower the maturation period.  People will lose interest rather quickly.  ",False

First and foremost - to stake the wallet has to be ACTIVE AND NOT SHUT DOWN.  The point of staking is to support the network. When someone stakes the wallet has to be connected to the network (we addressed this a little but earlier on in this thread). Shutting down your wallet and removing it from the network will actually stop it from staking.   Quote Okay, so the POS rate, while technically correct, is misleading.  There is no possible way the coin can yield a 12% return given a 30-day maturation.  This current setup is detrimental to the coin and incentivizes people to keep their wallets shut down.  This does not help the CIF network.  Lets be clear to define what cold storage is. When I recommend someone have a separate wallet used to hold CIF (for staking) - I mean a non-trading wallet (yet still connected to the network).  Quote You will need to raise the interest rate or lower the maturation period.  People will lose interest rather quickly.    We realize that there is a low interest rate because we created a PoW/PoS hybrid. People can still mine the coin through traditional methods. We made sure to put a limit on the interest earned from PoS since there will be both types of mining going on. We don't want the coin to be mined too quickly by offering a large PoS while running PoW. This was done intentionally.  To be 100% transparent - the PoS/PoW piece is an add on and incentive, but not the main benefit which we hope people to derive from our project and coin. These two pieces are meant to be ancillary items to our core project. We want the community to benefit, however we have a real business objective we feel will also drive up the value of CIF. People should look at the PoS portion of CIF as a nice add on to purchasing CIF coins, in recognition of the importance of the crypto community. We'll deliver much more value to CIF investors through our actual project.  I really hope that addresses your concerns - let me know if something doesn't make sense.",False

I got this through twitter's DM...  Quote PoS Questions for Scott  - I read on the bitcointalk announcement that in order to stake, one needs to have coins in the wallet and have the wallet online for 30 full days before staking occurs. Is this correct? - If the above is correct, lets say someone has their computer on with wallet open for 8 hours per day 7 days per week, would that mean staking wouldn't occur for three months? - Let's say I recieve 1000 CIF, during the next 30 days I make numerous small transactions in and out, how does this affect staking once we hit day 30? - Once a person successfully stakes once, does this reset their coin age back to zero? Does it affect all coins in their wallet, or just particular ones that were successfully staked? - I'm a big fan of CureCoin which also uses qt wallet and has staking. Their latest version of the wallet shows what my 'network weight' is and how long it will be until I can likely stake again. Will we see something like this in future wallet versions? - I want to make sure I get the percentages right. I've seen 1% written as the PoS amount, I also saw this on bitcoin talk as being ""12% per year"". Let's say I have 1000 CIF and keep them in an online wallet for 365 days. Assuming I can stake exactly every 30 days, how much CIF (roughly) will I have at the end of the year? - A lot of proof of stake systems tend to heavily favor those with massive balances. For example if I hold just 1 CIF, would I still be able to successfully stake every month, even if CIF becomes incredibly popular and my wallet is competing against businesses with wallet holding millions of CIF? - There's been some talk about master nodes and how they might appear in the future. Platforms like Dash requires a master node operator to own 1000 Dash, or about $300,000 USD worth of currency. If CIF makes use of master nodes in the future, what do you envision as a fair, secure minimum amount of CIF to hold in order to run a master node?    Also I just noticed the mining difficulty went up to 2.2, is someone already mining?  I can answer the masternode: it's an idea we are playing with. It's not an easy thing to do. If I'm not mistaken it even means we'll have to fork : ) In short: it's an idea we'd love to add but we have no details as of yet. We can't do the math yet, so we can't say anything sensible here : )",False

So the main premise of @CIF_Team is to keep a constant running news scroll regarding CIF and all things crypto. I realize that it seems like a bit much but it's bringing massive attention to our ICO and with attention means buyers and that means that everyone involved will have a coin worth more when the ICO is over (when we'll probably cut the twitter down a bit).  @Devnullius is the master behind this strategy as it helped GRWI secure almost 200 BTC from what I've been told - a very little time span.  Which brings me to the second point - @AdminCIF - a second twitter account where only important updates are posted. We don't run anything else on that account.  It's actually my personal account but serves the purpose of being dedicated for only the most important CIF news.

If we wanted people to stop mining it we couldn't release the wallets (or do airdrop or bounty etc.). Obviously we want to encourage participation in the ICO and mining won't give you incredible rewards but it will yield some CIF. So yes - some people are mining (you can check the explorer).

We have felt in no way, shape or form any reason to stop Canadians from participating in our ICO as we are not selling securities. I appreciate your concern however we are not facing the wall that KIN faced. Unfortunately sometimes there is misplaced judgement on the rules and regulations regarding cryptocurrency and ICO's because there's alot of misinformation however there is no reason for Canadians not to participate in our ICO.  Our coins will be used to purchase services offered, as well as used to incent & drive business to our product offerings.

One thing we strive to achieve is complete transparency as well as community engagement and support.  At the end of the day we realize that the community involved in our project will be the ones deciding if we're successful or not so we realize we have to treat them with the respect they deserve. We all realize that if we are truly going to make a run at legitimizing cryptocurrency, we have to look and act like any other established business with ethics and due process. This is the only way were going to have a chance at competing in the same space.

FYI our devs are based in Australia so we need to give them some time to address this as they are in a different time zone.  When new coins start out there is usually a lack of nodes since we don't have a large amount of people downloading (and cloning) the masternode daemon and running it in server mode.  As more users pickup on this project the network becomes more stable and there are greater redundancy points.  Just so everyone realizes that there is no issue with the actual wallet, just the growing pains of a new Coin. CIF is a custom blockchain which means a few things - there are lower transaction fees (no ETH Gas or BTC required) transactions are ultra fast, and you can mine CIF via PoS or PoW. These are some of the benefits of creating a custom blockchain. One of the side effects of creating a custom blockchain is that we don't have an existing network of a few million users (yet). As we grow and as people clone or daemon and host it the network grows stronger - so please be patient. An out of sync wallet doesn't mean your CIF are going anywhere - they're there to stay!  Thanks everyone for your patience and support of this project!",False

HELP EACH OTHER!     Hello guys, as you've might have noticed some of us cannot fully synchronize the CIF Wallet. We had another audit of our source code yesterday by a 3th independant party. They found no problems.  So the reason why some cannot connect almost certainly is due to the fact that we are not actively trading yet. (hell, we didn't even started our ICO!), so we don't have 1000s of wallets online to synchronize off of each other. Some wallets just remain in a blind spot..  THEREFORE A REQUEST TO THE COMMUNITY...! GIVE US YOUR PEERS! IF YOU HAVE A FULLY SYNCHRONIZED WALLET, PLEASE REPLY TO US YOUR PEER IP ADDRESSES! You can do this as follows:  --> In the wallet... Menu Help - Debug Console.  --> A console opens. Type the following command: getpeerinfo  --> This gives an output like this: ""addr"" : ""31.220.60.15:53621"",: Code: [ { ""addr"" : ""31.220.60.15:53621"", ""services"" : ""00000001"", ""lastsend"" : 1505672487, ""lastrecv"" : 1505672487, ""conntime"" : 1505663169, ""version"" : 60013, ""subver"" : ""/CryptoImprovementFund:1.6.0/"", ""inbound"" : false, ""startingheight"" : 6839, ""banscore"" : 0 }, { ""addr"" : ""[2001:0:9d38:953c:345b:979b:d1ee:6c43]:53621"", ""services"" : ""00000001"", ""lastsend"" : 1505672515, ""lastrecv"" : 1505672515, ""conntime"" : 1505663250, ""version"" : 60013, ""subver"" : ""/CryptoImprovementFund:1.6.0/"", ""inbound"" : false, ""startingheight"" : 6839, ""banscore"" : 0 } ]  Reply here with the IP addresses you get please.

We know the developers of our wallets personally and there was no malicious intent from anyone on our team. Upon further investigation we discovered the issue was not with the wallets themselves but with our VPS provider.  Although we paid for the highest level of security and the most robust protection with our VPS provider (and were repeatedly informed that we were rock solid secure) - we discovered that they did not enable an SSL certificate. This is an embarrassing conclusion however we are glad that this was flagged to us when it had such an inconsequential financial impact.  We were under the assumption that SSL was enabled and everyones web wallets were safe (that is what we paid for!). However, we immediately flagged the problem, escalated and are working on a permanent fix which will be implemented in under 3 hours. In doing so we can ensure the CIF community that this WILL NOT happen again.  We urge everyone to move their funds from their web wallet to an encrypted desktop wallet until informed otherwise. If you have LOST funds - please fill out this form with your new DESKTOP wallet address and you will be reimbursed from the CIF TEAMS portion of the token allocation.
