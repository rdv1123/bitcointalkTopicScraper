Generally brand online store does not give a significant revenue for retailer but takes away a lot of attention from main business.  We suggested a solution in the business-as-a-service format: to give a rights for brand’s domain, access to products stock and after that we will do everything ourselves — from content and advertising to delivering and searching opportunities for growth. Our payment model (percent from real revenue (revenue sharing)) fundamentally differ from other solutions because all contractors of online stores interest only in their revenue but we have the common goal with retailer.
