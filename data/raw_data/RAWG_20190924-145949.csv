And now it is our turn. One of the most popular business-related magazines has spoken with our founder Gadji Makhtiev.  RAWG is a blockchain-based platform for gamers that was born last year in the heads of Gadji and our CPO Alexey when they found out that their gaming website Kanobu attracted users for their gaming database. “Half of the visitors came looking specifically for our catalogue of game information” says Gadji while pondering that all the data that gamers need to check before deciding on what to play next is scattered throughout several services like Reddit, YouTube, Twitch, etc. The main problem for a gamer right now is “a lack of time, and gamers’ needs to make better purchasing decisions to fit their time constraints while still having fun”. Thus the idea of RAWG was conceived where gamers can get all they need in one neat package.  “Games are an art form” which is why RAWG is building the most comprehensive database that includes everyone who works on the games with the help of gamers themselves, their data and future contribution when the UGC-tools will be implemented.  The blockchain solution in the words of our founder is “to provide even greater incentives to join and participate in the RAWG community. Gamers on RAWG will be able to receive our tokens as rewards for in-game achievements, and they’ll be able to exchange them for rewards in our ecosystem, or even into fiat”. Achievement hunting in the past was to show off the skill and now they can be a way to earn some pocket money. Blockchain itself is the “technological edge” that the gaming market needs to propel itself even further and RAWG is eager to ride that wave among the first.

RAWG’s answer to most of these limitations is expansion of the gamers’ choice. With RAWG the player is able to get rewards for any game that has trackable achievements across the most popular platforms: Xbox, PS, Steam. These rewards can be spent on physical and digital goods, or turned into fiat or other cryptocurrencies. And all of it is done with a simple click on RAWG’s website.

And won!  We are building RAWG as an international project with the clear goal of creating a global community around gamers. So we’re always searching for a way to make RAWG known all over the world.  “International conferences are essential part of business development in the cryptoworld. Block Forum in Vilnius was very important to us in regards to our expansion in Europe. The event was organized with the help of Startup Europe from European Commission so we expected a number of prominent startup incubators and investors. Blockchain conference in Astana was vital to us in terms of networking and testing out the waters for the project. Kazakhstan is a perfect place for such tests as there’s no language barrier,” said our COO Dasha Lyalin about both events.  Our CTO Samat Galimov was pitching in Vilnius. His story is a bit more start-up like and contains a little bit of technological magic which awed one of the journalists present at the event.  Originally Dasha Lyalin was supposed to be the spokesperson but her flight got delayed by 24 hours so Samat had to step up to the challenge. Not surprisingly, he did. Here’s his story: “The competition was fierce and we were the last to pitch. The rules were strict and there were only 5 minutes. And to make matters worse, the presentation remote was broken. With such strict rules a phrase “next slide” throws your pitch out of the window. So I asked the organisers to switch the slides whenever I raise my right arm. Which made our pitch much more dynamic. So a little bit of magic and a strong project itself were all that we needed to grab the first place at Blockhain Forum”.  Here’s the magic of Samat Galimov  Just an hour before Samat showed his magic tricks, our founder Gadji Makhtiev stood on the stage in Astana. The conference was running late so the speakers were hurried which left Gadji only 8 minutes to wow the crowd and the judges. This hurdle was cleared with ease as the working product, a clear structured presentation and our notion of transparency secured the win. And with his victory speech Gadji doubled down on our transparency and trust, saying: “I’d like to highlight how important trust is in business. It is currently at zero on the credibility scale. We visit many conferences where we see tired people, with glassy stares uninterested in what’s happening around them. They pitch their projects, but they don’t believe in their own product and as a result they don’t believe in the success of ICO. There are many entrepreneurs stating competence and professionalism, but as soon as they position themselves on the market—they fail. That’s the main reason we have a problem in trust between the investor and the fund-raiser. It’s important to understand that ICO is an amazing business instrument. The ones ruining its credibility are people. When working on our project we don’t distinguish between our venture investors and our crypto investors/crypto-funds. We believe that each and every one of them has the right to know what we spend their money on. They have the right to check what transactions we make, why we make them. Press-releases are not enough. Telegram news or quarterly reports are not enough. ICO model has set its course to self-destruction and the only way of fixing the problem is transparency.”  This is RAWG’s promise to become one of the trustworthy projects in the sea of fraud and scam.  We’re happy to see that our colleagues in the crypto world have acknowledged the value of RAWG! We’d like to thank you, the community, as you’re one of the integral parts of these wins with your support and belief in our project.",False

Don’t worry, the fundamentals are the same. You play your favorite video games and get tokens.  What’s changed though is our tokenomics model for advertising. It used to be like this. For three years after the end of the crowdsale a potential advertiser would only be able to trade one RAWG token and nothing else for 10 views on the website. More RAWG tokens = more views, of course. But now it will be only 1 year after the crowdsale and a bonus system afterwards. The bonus system is straightforward: the advertiser will be able to buy views with fiat, but if he pays with token, he will get 30% discount. So let’s say, they want 1000 views and the price of one RAWG token on the exchange is $1. If they buy with fiat, they pay $30. But if they decide to pay in RAWG tokens, they will only need to pay $21 (21 RAWG tokens).

Hongkong was a great opportunity to dive in the cryptocommunity that is present in China, and it was very educational, to say the least. We met with people who provided very valuable feedback on how to properly and efficiently work with the Chinese community. As our founder, Gadji Makhtiev, already mentioned, we were glad to converse with several prominent figures and pitch RAWG to them. All in all, Hongkong was a very niche and high-quality event.  Kiev was the first event where we were invited as experts on the subject, no one rushed us to finish the presentation which was so uplifting. There was no need to rush and stumble, we delivered it calmly and at our own pace. Our goal was to educate the community on how to “unchain gamers” by adding the cryptobased solution with RAWG as an example. The audience were the developers who are tipping their toes in blockchain world so our words didn’t fall on deaf ears. After the presentation we were able to talk to Malcolm Casselle, CEO of WAX, who shared his experience with us. WAX is also a cryptogaming company, a virtual good marketplace for online videogames that run a successful crowdsale a year ago. He told us what were the biggest hurdles when they were preparing, running and maintaining the crowdsale in regards to legal, exchange listings, community management. We’ll make sure to work on that feedback. Also, had a meeting with VR soft and hardware developers from Japan who were ready to discuss our project and provide their own insight on the market and the community. Japan is yet another lucrative market for us to enter so this talk was very productive. In conclusion, I have to say, that it’s great to see such a global community which is working together to bring closer two innovative industries to create something greater.
