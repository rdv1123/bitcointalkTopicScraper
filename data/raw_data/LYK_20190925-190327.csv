It is meant to cover both intra-Ethereum and cross-chain.  Risks     Token reconciliation and settlement will be done in 8-12 weeks after the conclusion of the token open sale event. With the event ending in July, that means tokens won’t be trading until October. -2     A $45 million hard cap is on the higher side. -2     The token doesn’t have many ways to bleed value to holders. No master nodes or token burning going on. The token must gain its value purely from demand to use the platform.-2  Growth Potential     They already have several partnerships. After briefly exploring into each of them, it looks like there are some very legit partnerships mostly to help Loyakk build its infrastructure. +4     Many of the core team members played big roles in the past for SAP, which is very popular worldwide; it is used to coordinate all the resources, information and activities needed to complete enterprise-wide information systems billing, including accounting and finance. It was also learned in an interview with the CEO that Loyakk will officially partner with SAP. +4     Enterprise Security Magazine names Loyakk a ‘Top 10 Blockchain Solution Vendor -2018’. +2     The team looks really strong, as evidenced by this reply from the CEO when asked about his MVP: “We have V1 built (with approx 400K+ lines of code) and deployed by customers. V2 with Vega Blockchain aspects is being designed and built. Blockchain patents have been filed, token def published on github, relationship modeller showcased via demo video, and broader demo is almost done. As per Roadmap, Vega will be ready in Q3/Q4 timeframe”. +3  Disposition This is one of those projects with unlimited upside, and a seemingly high floor since being partnered with SAP pretty much guarantees they are around for years to come. 7/10 Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-loyakk/",False
