The problem is that the vast majority of players lose and don't have even a slightest chance to affect the work of the casino in any way. Thus, the key issues of the market are:  Casino customers are very venturous people who are constantly looking for action and novelty; they get bored quickly, and are forced to move from one casino to another constantly looking for something different. It is very difficult for the casinos to attract new players, and they are forced to spend significant part of the profits on advertising, bonuses, affiliate programs and other gimmicks to attract customers. No matter how much money casino spends to keep customers for as long as possible, it doesn't work - customers simply won't stay for long.   How URUNIT is going to solve these problems  Absolutely all games, card tables, poker rooms, tournaments, slot machines on this platform are controlled by the players themselves.  The easiest way to give each user the opportunity to become the owner of the game is drawing of the lots. Drawings are held automatically. The winners should pay a small fee in URUN tokens to confirm their right to own the game. This player determines the parameters of the game or tournament he is hosting and becomes the owner of the game for the time being. Let's say, each game is leased to one of the players for a nominal fee. During this lease, the owner of the game not only monitors what is going on, but also performs basic functions of a moderator. At the end of this period, the owner of the game receives most of the profit generated during his lease.   Just imagine, if there is a choice, who would want to play in a regular casino that does not offer a possibility to become a part of it   https://www.urunit.io/pics/new_standart_2.png   Our key competitive advantages  Players are no more playing against the casino, they compete with each other for the right to host the game. As a result, the whole venue and all the processes therein turns into one big exciting game. The excitement and interest of the casino players doubles or even triples. Significant reduction in costs of attracting and retaining players along with exponential growth in the popularity of the platform, as well as the number of its users    Roadmap    https://www.urunit.io/pics/road_map_1.png      Project Team  We have a strong team with all the necessary skills, talents and experience to launch the project and market it successfully. You can meet all members of our team on our website.   URUN Token   Token is created by ERC-20 standard and used within the platform for:  users payments for services within the platform transactions between the platform users payments to the third-party game developers payments from the operators   Embedded Deflation  First gambling platform with constantly decreasing number of tokens.    https://www.urunit.io/pics/token_distrib.png    Total number of URUN tokens issued during the ICO is 80 000 000, and those will be the only tokens issued by URUNIT. No URUN tokens will be issued after the ICO. 0.5% of every transaction on the platform made in URUN tokens is “burnt”. Consider URUN tokens “fuel” for the platform transactions processing. This “burning process” is regulated by smart contracts on the blockchain. It means the number of URUN tokens available will constantly decrease.    Token Distribution and Use of Funds    https://www.urunit.io/pics/td_7.png     Tokens Sales Scheduler    https://www.urunit.io/pics/ts_1.png    Unsold tokens will be distributed proportionally among those who bought our tokens during pre-Sale and ICO stages    No pump & dump   Founders: (tokens are frozen for 2 years) .

The problem is that the vast majority of players lose and don't have even a slightest chance to affect the work of the casino in any way. Thus, the key issues of the market are:  Casino customers are very venturous people who are constantly looking for action and novelty; they get bored quickly, and are forced to move from one casino to another constantly looking for something different. It is very difficult for the casinos to attract new players, and they are forced to spend significant part of the profits on advertising, bonuses, affiliate programs and other gimmicks to attract customers. No matter how much money casino spends to keep customers for as long as possible, it doesn't work - customers simply won't stay for long.   How URUNIT is going to solve these problems  Absolutely all games, card tables, poker rooms, tournaments, slot machines on this platform are controlled by the players themselves.  The easiest way to give each user the opportunity to become the owner of the game is drawing of the lots. Drawings are held automatically. The winners should pay a small fee in URUN tokens to confirm their right to own the game. This player determines the parameters of the game or tournament he is hosting and becomes the owner of the game for the time being. Let's say, each game is leased to one of the players for a nominal fee. During this lease, the owner of the game not only monitors what is going on, but also performs basic functions of a moderator. At the end of this period, the owner of the game receives most of the profit generated during his lease.   Just imagine, if there is a choice, who would want to play in a regular casino that does not offer a possibility to become a part of it     Our key competitive advantages  Players are no more playing against the casino, they compete with each other for the right to host the game. As a result, the whole venue and all the processes therein turns into one big exciting game. The excitement and interest of the casino players doubles or even triples. Significant reduction in costs of attracting and retaining players along with exponential growth in the popularity of the platform, as well as the number of its users    Roadmap         Project Team  We have a strong team with all the necessary skills, talents and experience to launch the project and market it successfully. You can meet all members of our team on our website.   URUN Token   Token is created by ERC-20 standard and used within the platform for:  users payments for services within the platform transactions between the platform users payments to the third-party game developers payments from the operators   Embedded Deflation  First gambling platform with constantly decreasing number of tokens.       Total number of URUN tokens issued during the ICO is 80 000 000, and those will be the only tokens issued by URUNIT. No URUN tokens will be issued after the ICO. 0.5% of every transaction on the platform made in URUN tokens is “burnt”. Consider URUN tokens “fuel” for the platform transactions processing. This “burning process” is regulated by smart contracts on the blockchain. It means the number of URUN tokens available will constantly decrease.    Token Distribution and Use of Funds        Tokens Sales Scheduler       Unsold tokens will be distributed proportionally among those who bought our tokens during pre-Sale and ICO stages    No pump & dump   Founders: (tokens are frozen for 2 years) .
