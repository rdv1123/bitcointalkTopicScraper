The P2P lending is an innovative scheme for achieving this objective.  🔺Parties to the P2P Lending🔺  ✔️LENDER: A lender is a trader who has in his wallet,  funds he considers surplus to his immediate trading requirements and wants to earn on it rather than leave it idle. ✔️BORROWER: Borrowers are traders seeking to trade with equity greater than what they currently have in their wallets. ✔️POOL MANAGER : Algorithm developed to manage and coordinate the P2P lending process by managing the liquidity pool.  🔺The Process🔺 ✔️ Willing lender transfers funds (BTC) to the liquidity pool and specifies how many days he wishes to lend for (7,14 or 30 days) with an option to rollover ✔️ Prospective borrower sends request to pool to request for funds and specifies number of days. ✔️Pool manager matches borrowers request with lenders offer on a first come, first served basis and executes transfer of funds between parties  🔺Interest rate🔺 Lending rates are varied on a daily basis, calculated by pool manager algorithm which uses market conditions to determine the rates. Contracts are activated based on prevailing rates at time of match.  ✅Pool manager manages the lend contract by tracking all trades excuted with lent funds. If borrower’s trading losses erodes his own equity, pool manager closes all open trades to prevent loss of borrowed equity and gives borrower  time to re-fund his own equity contribution to resume trading. If borrower fails to fund, borrowed funds are returned to lender at the expiration of tenor.  ✅Lender earns interest regardless of trading outcome.",False

I wonder if it will be anonymous or will it have to be verified?  This is a good question, now I am also curious about this. Let's wait for the team to answer your question. I am looking forward for more active team members of bitmillex also an active updates too.   This i will explain with a two-sided view.  1. Requiring users to update their personal details and verifying same is actually a security feature in itself. One of the reasons behind it, is to ensure that actual account owners have access to funds in wallets.   2. it is a compliance issue. A compliant exchange is a safer exchange to trade and have funds on than an exchange that can be subjected to litigations and regulatory clampdowns that might end up affecting the funds and investments of users.  So, while it is our aim and desire to avoid bottlenecks and rigidity, safety of investors funds is higher on our scale of priorities. We assure you that any form of verification we carry out will be done under best practices and will never lead to compromise of investors personal details",False

Why We Are The Most Complete Platform      Roadmap       Updates/News  Check Update #1 - Intro welcome message  Check Update #2 - Airdrop has closed in a record time of 76 hours   🔶 The Bitmillex Auto-Trade Feature Summary 🔶  ✅This feature is designed for the following categories of traders; the newbies, the less skilled, the ones who do not have the time to trade and those who seek passive income without active involvement.  ✅It works on the principle of Copy Trading, where there is the copier (or follower) and the leader.  ✅On the exchange will exist a pool called “my cryptobook” where any trader who wishes to participate can register and make his trading performance visible to everyone else on the platform. It is a ranking of the top traders on the exchange which can be sorted by period, by number of trades and by amount(BTC and USD) made in profits.  Beside each ranked trader will be a follow button.  ✅Traders who wish to follow a trader will review the performances and select which trader they wish to follow by clicking the follow button. The follower will decide how much of his available balance he wishes to commit to the leader and further determine how much of the committed funds should be allocated to each trade.  ✅Traders are allowed to set a stop-loss percentage. This means if the cumulative amount committed to a particular leader drops by the set stop-loss percentage, all open trades will be automatically closed.  ✅The leader receives a percentage of the profits made by his followers.  101 REASONS NOT TO MISS BITMILLEX ICO  ✔️ 1# The Bitmillex ICO is for two exchanges. 1 ICO, 2 exchanges. A hybrid approach that will birth a centralized platform and a decentralized one in Q1 2019.  ✔️ 2# Bitmillex is being hosted on the most advanced and secure servers. On this and at full launch, we are partnering with Amazon Web Service and will operate a fail-safe system with alternative, fully dedicated cloud server backup.  ✔️ 3# Bitmillex partners with world #1 hacker powered security platform, Hackerone to conduct a continuous vulnerability checking and fixing program. (This works by having over 100,000 hackers on their network have a continuous go at Bitmillex systems to look for loopholes and areas of weakness. For every weakness found, it is immediately sealed in collaboration with the Bitmillex developers. This will go on until there is no known vulnerability)  ✔️ 4# Bitmillex shall at every instant hold no greater than 2% of total investor funds online,The remaining 98% shall be offline in secure cold wallets. (And the 2% online shall be fully insured against any form of loss)  ✔️ 5# The Bitmillex servers shall be connected to custom built hardware security modules (HSM) to safeguard and manage all digital keys for superior authentication and protection of cryptographic keys. (This is what the big banks use to secure their servers that is why we never hear of them being hacked. Only one or two known cryptocurrency exchanges have this feature)  ✔️ 6# On Bitmillex exchange, users can buy and sell BTC and ETH directly to and from other users in a unique peer to peer arrangement (Like what is done on Paxful)",False
