Spotcoin will unlock the market, giving millions of people easy access to digital currencies for the first time. Spotcoin has been an established OTC in the area since 2016, but only for larger investors who are spending at least $25,000 USD in a single transaction.  Our automated Spotcoin exchange will make it possible for a mass market to buy digital currencies and tokens. This is especially relevant for this region, which is very advanced in its adoption of blockchain technology, and the subject of digital currencies gets plenty of attention among the public. An abundance of cheap electricity makes the region one of the largest providers of currency mining, and there is a great deal of interest among younger people to work in the field. This is a large market waiting for an exchange providing easy fiat to currency access, and Spotcoin will be the first to offer it.  2) Simple liquidity for the NEO We believe wholeheartedly in NEO. NEO is among the most future-proof blockchains because of its current 10,000 TPS capability, and its plans to scale to 100,000 TPS by 2020. However, NEO does at times feel constraints through a lack of direct, simple liquidity. There is little direct free flow of fiat currency to NEO and other NEP-5 based tokens, and Spotcoin will be one of the first to solve that issue. We will provide an easy to use, intuitive interface for the safe trading of not just NEO, but of all NEP-5 standard based tokens that adhere to City of Zion principles, which will be listed on Spotcoin for free. At this time, no other exchange out there offers the same service, and it will provide relief for NEO and all NEO-based companies out there.  3) Highest token dividend Our SPOT token is a dividend token. Unlike some other exchanges, we haven’t tried to force our token into our exchange process as a redundant way to create a use and demand for it. We’re keeping the business clean and simple. Just like our offer: SPOT token holders will receive 51% of all of the exchange fees from our automated exchange. Every week. To our knowledge, no other exchange offers a dividend this high.  4) Dividends from more than just the exchange Our Spotcoin exchange will not be the only source of revenue, or of dividends. You will receive a 12% dividend from the net profits of our other business lines, quarterly. Like we said, Spotcoin is already an established OTC. We processed over 10 million USD in 2017. We also partner in a 1.1MW Mining Operation, benefitting from Georgia’s cheap and abundant hydropower.  We have partnered with mining experts Golden Fleece, and aim to expand our joint operations. We have plans to develop SpotPay, a retail application that provides flexible payments using digital currencies to both retailer and consumer. Furthermore, we are an important part of the Black Sea Blockchain Institute, a business incubator and educator in Georgia. As we grow, so will the dividends.   5) More than one leg to stand on Rather than having one pillar for our business, we have several, creating synergies and risk mitigation. Our OTC, our mining operation, our future automated exchange, and retail payment application all provide streams of digital and fiat currencies. At the heart of our system sits our proprietary Spotcore engine, that constantly finds our optimal liquidity. Together, our business lines provide much more stability and security than any single business can. And all SPOT token holders will benefit from them, every week and again every quarter.",False

Speaking of his role in the formation of a business accelerator in the country, Nikoloz Khundzakishvili spoke of his long-term goal to transform Georgia into a startup nation. “We have resources that are everywhere,” said Khundzakishvili, CORA Director at Efes Brewery in Georgia.  “Accelerators pretty much didn’t exist in Georgia at all ten years ago,” said Andrew Thornhill, co-founder of digital currency exchange Spotcoin. “Generally speaking, incubation provides capital and mentorship, and that works,” he said.  It is why Spotcoin is using a significant portion of funds raised in its upcoming ICO to fund a new academic facility in the region. The Black Sea Blockchain Institute will teach software developers and business executives, and provide resources for start-ups and scale-ups in the region.  “Giving money without structure is losing money. It’s just throwing it away,” Thornhill said.  Khundzakishvili noted that it there is an economic shift underway, where there is more emphasis on selling technology and taking leadership in this latest industrial revolution instead of selling labor. It is a main reason why investment in business incubators is so important.  Blockchain start-ups can also solve governmental issues related to public safety and data security, said Avtandil Kasradze, the Deputy Chairman of Georgia’s Innovation and Technology Agency. These ambitious businesses are also creating opportunities by furthering new approaches to healthcare, medicine, and the environment.  “Opportunities are here. Resources are here. Let’s open the channel to Silicon Valley,” Khundzakishvili said.  Digital currency exchange Spotcoin organized the affair, the first major blockchain conference in the country. Around 200 people attended the event, held at Tbilisi’s unique pop-up concept Fabrika.  Interested in Spotcoin or SPOT?

An expert on marketing, media, PR and digital currency strategy, Cocking has advised several ICO launches which achieved their financial targets. Simon Cocking is also Senior Editor at Irish Tech News, Editor in Chief at CryptoCoinNews, and freelances for other publications. He is currently ranked number 1 on People of Blockchain, and he holds the top spot among all ICObench advisors. Spotcoin is an established OTC based in Tblisi, Georgia and will have its initial coin offering (ICO) on May 1st.  “I have been educating people about blockchain and its opportunities around the world,” Cocking said. “Spotcoin’s mission to make digital currencies work for everyone resonates with me. Of course, I had a look at how Spotcoin plans to do this, and I am happy to join and contribute.”  “Simon is one of those special finds: a true expert who as a tech journalist has a real understanding of not just the potential of the technology, but also gets how it works and is able to easily explain it to others,” said Spotcoin CEO Tim Gick. He has gained his large following by staying true to his journalistic beliefs and steering clear of paid endorsements. His top ranking on ICObench shows both his knowledge and his integrity. We’re delighted he agreed to join Spotcoin, as we know he rejects ICOs and projects he doesn’t believe in.”  In the run-up to the May 1 ICO, Spotcoin has grown its team from a lean, profitable OTC to a much larger enterprise that looks to provide a seamless user experience that simply bridges the gap between legacy currencies and digital assets.

We've spent countless hours on which platform made the most business sense. It wasn't cheap since we needed 500 GAS to start the token, but a small investment for a bigger gain. When the NEP-5 tokens receive USD/EUR trading pairs, those markets will do very well. We want to decouple NEO and GAS from BTC in the future.
