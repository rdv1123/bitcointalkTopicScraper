Conservative - These are very safe investments that grow over a long period of time. If you are comfortable accepting lower returns with low risk investments, this is for you. 2.   Moderately Conservative - is ideal for those who values principal preservation, but is comfortable accepting a small degree of risk and volatility to seek some degree of appreciation. Invest on this portfolio if you desire greater liquidity, is willing to accept lower returns, and is willing to accept minimal losses. 3.   Moderate - Moderate investing may be low or moderate risk. These have long-term returns and with modest and considerable risk. You are a moderate investor if you accept value reducing risk and want reasonable, but relatively stable income and capital growth. 4.   Moderately Aggressive – Investment with higher long-term returns with significant risk. If you believe that higher long-term returns are more important than protecting principal and can endure large losses in favour of potentially higher long-term returns, then you fall on this category. 5.   Aggressive – A portfolio management that attempts to maximize returns by taking a relatively higher degree of risk. It involves extensive volatility and significant losses. Along with the prospect of higher returns, aggressive investments also carry a higher-than-average risk of losing significant amount of your investment. You would be an aggressive investor if you believe maximizing long-term returns is more important than protecting principal and liquidity is generally not your concern.",False

Skraps’ platform is focused on keeping the user experience very simple and intuitive so that anyone, young and old alike can come on the platform and start their investing journey and create their cryptocurrency portfolio.  Easy to invest. Skraps has designed investing cryptocurrencies, in three very easy steps. Just remember this 3 letters: CSI, and it’s as easy as pie.   Low cognitive load Since all the investments are made from the spare change of a transaction, you don’t need to consciously decide if you want to invest and how much you want to invest. You just need to choose how much you want to round up to, and the spare amount is invested directly in a portfolio of your choice. Pretty soon you become accustomed to rounding off your purchases and investing becomes your second nature.  Invest based on your risk preference In Skraps, you can choose to invest in a portfolio which suits the risk you prefer. Whether you are a conservative or aggressive investor, Skraps has something to offer. If you are a risk taker type, then you can invest in Aggressive Portfolio. This portfolio can generate a higher rate of return but is subjected to higher market risk. If you are a modest risk taker, a Conservative Portfolio would be more suited as you would not want to risk your savings. Conservative investment has lower rate of risk and a lower return.  You control what you invest Since investment starts with every transaction, you control how much you invest by how much you round off your transaction in a fractional amount, and the spare amount is invested directly in a portfolio of your choice. With Skraps platform, the “spare change” you would normally forget in your purse, bag or coat pockets will go a long way. Try compounding your investment and see how far your spare change go.  No onerous requirements Skraps made cryptocurrency investing as simple and intuitive as possible. Some of the salient features of their platform are: ● No minimum or maximum amount of investments ● No minimum or maximum balance ● No withdrawal fees ● No payment delays. Instant payment processing ● Instant withdrawals ● Anonymous. No social security numbers required  Secured Data All of your data is protected with 256-bit encryption and never stored on your devices. Customers’ peace of mind is Skraps’ highest priority. and they work hard to protect users’ information, prevent unauthorized account access and notify you of any unusual activity in your account.  Leader board and Community Incentives Skraps will also have an additional ""Leaderboard"" feature that allows any user to create a portfolio and share it with the network. Portfolio owners will earn tokens from those who wish to copy their portfolios.  As a Skraps portfolio manager, you will have 20% share from users and 5% fee for Skraps platform paid monthly calculated on the profit and not on the whole amount. This is payable every 31st day.  However, if your portfolio manager failed and made losses, Skraps will waive off everything; no 20% to fund manager, no 5% platform fee to Skraps. It’s a no gain no fee situation. No “rubbing of salt to the wound” so to speak!  With SKRAPS, you can make total or partial withdrawal in your choice of currency, directly to your wallet or bank account in any currency of your choice.  It will be connected to a few exchanges where it will buy from, but the coins will stay in Skrap platform and so you will have a wallet for each crypto that you own.  Skraps will list the top 50 cryptocurrency in the market and will continually add more to suit community.",False

Understand the risks involved, and pay attention to past trends as well. History does indeed repeat itself, and investors know this first hand!  Below is a description of Skraps’ different portfolios initially on offer:  Conservative - These are very safe investments that grow over a long period of time. If you are comfortable accepting lower returns with low risk investments, this is for you. Moderately Conservative - is ideal for those who values principal preservation, but is comfortable accepting a small degree of risk and volatility to seek some degree of appreciation. Invest on this portfolio if you desire greater liquidity, is willing to accept lower returns, and is willing to accept minimal losses. Moderate - Moderate investing may be low or moderate risk. These have long-term returns and with modest and considerable risk. You are a moderate investor if you accept value reducing risk and want reasonable, but relatively stable income and capital growth. Moderately Aggressive – Investment with higher long-term returns with significant risk. If you believe that higher long-term returns are more important than protecting principal and can endure large losses in favour of potentially higher long-term returns, then you fall on this category. Aggressive – A portfolio management that attempts to maximize returns by taking a relatively higher degree of risk. It involves extensive volatility and significant losses. Along with the prospect of higher returns, aggressive investments also carry a higher-than-average risk of losing significant amount of your investment. You would be an aggressive investor if you believe maximizing long-term returns is more important than protecting principal and liquidity is generally not your concern. All these portfolios are designed by experienced cryptocurrency managers who will invest in assets guided by the risk-return profile of the selected portfolio. These portfolios will be accessible by users for free. Each user will be able to view the contents of every portfolio and even copy it in order to use it on other exchanges. Users can freely switch between different portfolios as well, without any switching charges.",False

Conservative - These are very safe investments that grow over a long period of time. If you are comfortable accepting lower returns with low risk investments, this is for you.  2.   Moderately Conservative - is ideal for those who values principal preservation, but is comfortable accepting a small degree of risk and volatility to seek some degree of appreciation. Invest on this portfolio if you desire greater liquidity, is willing to accept lower returns, and is willing to accept minimal losses.  3.   Moderate - Moderate investing may be low or moderate risk. These have long-term returns and with modest and considerable risk. You are a moderate investor if you accept value reducing risk and want reasonable, but relatively stable income and capital growth.  4.   Moderately Aggressive – Investment with higher long-term returns with significant risk. If you believe that higher long-term returns are more important than protecting principal and can endure large losses in favour of potentially higher long-term returns, then you fall on this category.  5.   Aggressive – A portfolio management that attempts to maximize returns by taking a relatively higher degree of risk. It involves extensive volatility and significant losses. Along with the prospect of higher returns, aggressive investments also carry a higher-than-average risk of losing significant amount of your investment. You would be an aggressive investor if you believe maximizing long-term returns is more important than protecting principal and liquidity is generally not your concern.",False
