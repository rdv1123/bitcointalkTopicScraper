I joined in the process of getting new exchanges to make sure Crypviser will do everything possible to get us asap listed.All i can say is that Crypviser did really everything and were even willing to pay a high commission to get listed quick at a good exchange just to satisfy their community. However as you can see exchanges are currently changing because of regulations.Some do it officaly and some behind closed doors. I contacted myself nearly all exchanges.Because of regulations and because of Crypvisers product there were no quick solution to get listed however exchanges said clearly that they are very interrested in crypviser and once crypviser will fullfill their new regulations they are going to talk about listing it. Some exchanges are even in direct contact to get CVN as quick as possible listed. The big time consumer are the new regulations which nobody could expect so early and which is causing the waiting because Crypviser is not an open source product.  However knowing which exchanges are interrested in Crypviser and also knowing which will probably announced in short term i can make a private bet with you that Crypviser will be a far better investment than BTC when comparing from august till febuary.    wow hahaha you just pay 1 btc to a forum member cuz he made a bet? but you are to greedy to pay the bittrex fee???   That is total nonsense.Bittrex is being hit hard by regulations. You can pay Bittrex 200 BTC and you won't get listed because of regulations. A coin like BTS got kicked out/fozen because of the word ""shares"" in their name. So it has nothing to do with payment.",False

Whats the volume of Binance ?   120 Millions  And Quoine ? 500 Millions trading their pairs only against fiat which means real liquidity  Now have a look at QRYPTOS a new product from Quoine. Its having negativ trading fees !!! What does it mean ? It means that you get paid for each trade you make. Thats the first exchange in the world paying people for each trade instead of asking for a fee. You can bet that this exchange will soon skyrocket. This concept is to bring quick liquidity to every coin on that exchange and there only a few.  About Binance.Its still valid.Binance asked to review an existing Product.After the positiv review they are going to list CVCoin on Binance which hopefully will happen this month.  Now about SZZC.If you had a look at SZZC you would be aware that this exchange is closed so even if CVCoin would be listed there we couldn't be currently trading. Rumors are saying china will soon legalise BTC and exchanges by providing licenses and when this happens the door to SZZC and other chinese exchanges are open again.  About Bitshares. Bitshares was the best choice Vadim could ever make.I was pissed about that decission like the majority here because it preventet CVCoin to have a quick profit however after studying BTS and EOS carefully i understood it was the best decission ever made. Why ?Because BTS and EOS are the future.ETH Network is currently on its peak and only able to get 4000 transactions per second. BTS is already able to handle 100.000 transaction per second and has a great decentralised exchange which is in advance of its time and because of that undervalued. If you watch other successfull exchanges their master goal is to get decentralised. Next big thing about BTS is EOS.Why EOS ?Because you can say EOS is a product of BTS to raise funds (even there is a solid company with black.one) .The new EOS network will be able to handle 1.000.000 transactions per second and even in peak time it will be way under 1 sec to execute. More EOS is soon to announce 1 Billion USD for projects to build arround their infrastructur. That amount of money was never seen before.Even ETH's sources are already talking about switching completly to EOS. So whats the benefit for BTS from EOS ?It will get all the technology from EOS for low cost.  Have a look what John McAfee says about Decentralised Exchanges https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=69&v=TRjEiAu0IOI  and Startups switching to BTS https://news.bitcoin.com/remittance-startup-bitspark-drops-bitcoin-over-network-fees/   So as you can see very very positiv 30 days ahead.,False

He was correct about the exchange, but not about the price and scam. I said CVCoin never traded under 1 BTS and that the project was NOT a scam. I still believe project is good and legit. You as a team are failing and putting your interrests before the investorst. I could understand that in the beginning and also some time later on.  I was thinking gheez they worked hard for this, so they will do it later on, but this later on never came.   It's all here, everyone can check back this thread.  I'm an investor also in other big projects, why am i NOT banned there?!   I never been banned anywhere.

All i can say is that Crypviser is doing everything to get listed on exchanges asap. There have been complications but not created by Crypviser but regulations and other topics. A small info i can provide for people asking for even smaller exchanges. Livecoin = not accepting coins for 2 months HitBTC   = not accepting Bitshare Network anymore Binance = requests live product since its not open source but they are very interrested SZZC    = Regulations Yobit     = not possible Cryptopia = would kill better exchanges  and the list goes on.  I talked already with the CEO of Binance myself and he is very positiv on CVCOIN/CVN to get listed on Binance however he needs a live product since crypviser is not an open source project and therfor they can't check if there is progress.However CVN is a solid coin for them and CEO of Binance is in direct contact with Vadim and even sending Ashley to our slack to have a look. Vadim is also in contact with 2 more exchanges which maybe will make an execption and will list CVN even they are not listing new coins atm.,False

Some holders lost access to their wallets, thereby in cooperation with OpenLedger we offer this service to restore the access. Technically it means moving from the origin (lost) wallet to a new one. So, there is nothing about distribution of new tokens. This option for CVCOIN will be available until end of September 2017.  Taking this opportunity I would advise and remind all CVCoin holders to make a backup of wallet and keep it safe place and do not forget the password. Making backup it's very simple process, allows to restore Wallet and move it to another devices.  In this case, Bitshares wallet is very safe place to keep tokens, not only CVCOIN, as well as BTC, ETH or other support currencies. But in case of lost backup or password, recovering process is not easy and require manual work. This is a reason we charge special fee 10% for this.  However this is a special fee approved by OpenLedger for CVCoin ICO participants. The normal regular rate to restore Bitshare wallets (GOODWILL service) provided by OpenLedger costs 30%  Crypviser cares of its community and have agreed for 10% during the limited time for CVCOIN only.",False

Investors are well aware of the risk and can decide themself if they want to move their coins to an exchange or not You know exectly that CVCoin won't raise on OL since there is no liquidity at all and taking longer will make it only harder to raise CVCoin prices as many people will just dump their coins as soon as some liquidity comes I supported CVCoin so many times by adding buy walls  and got each time disappointed since your announcement never happened and you don't even bothered to inform the community about it",False

After that next active promotion from 3rd August.Also didnt happened.A Buywall to hold minimum price. Now activ promotion this week and classic major exchanges in august. The question is what is a ""classic major exchange"" Also like i said before the big issue with liquidity.If you watch OL somebody dumped today some coins and the door is open for the price to decrease to 0.6 BTS.There is no more support wall at 1.1 BTS...... its gone. People dumping everywhere  CVCoin/BTS , CVCoin/USD ,CVCoin/BTC .  Why are people taking the loss ?Looks like they are not happy with the result and announcement of crypviser myself included  Why ?  Quote - starting official trading support on Bitshares DEX from 03 August 2017 It means that we are starting to provide support to the CVCOIN market rate by disclosing the current development state, business model, token circulation plan. Provide simple and video guides for newbies and starter set how to trade secure and safe on Bitshares DEX. As well as we will carry out all possible actions to increase the liquids, trade volumes and keep the minimum price of CVCOIN.   So major goal is to increase liquidity in DEX in an exchange without liquidity where just $10k daily volume has the 5th biggest coin there.    Quote  - Disclosing detailed business model of Crypviser  - Reporting the final token circulation plan, including 5 mln. Reserved company's fund  - Publish the achivement reports of July 2017 (the first month on completion of ICO)  Adding information to its own investors will bring more liquidity on DEX ?   Quote - Special report on the listing on the future of major exchanges  There were already announcements that we will get 2 exchanges mid july and major ones during july-august-september. Did it increased the liquidity on DEX ?  Quote - Updated development plan and important notices for the ALFA and BETA versions of Crypviser app for secure social communication. I doubt this will bring any liquidity to DEX  Quote - Current announcements, such as launching a brand new media channel on Youtube powered by Crypviser Launching a new youtube channel will bring new investors to DEX ?I can open today 100 new channels but it won't bring a single investor at all    And now the most concerning post from crypviser  Quote At the end, I would love to pay your kind attention, that we have slight shifts in terms of earlier stated terms based on the general state of the market and circumstances that are independent of us.  First of all did any of you got an information or announcement that crypviser changed the terms ?I doubt so.They change terms and don't even feel to inform about it. Also the term ""that are independent of us"" makes me feel very uncomfortable. javascript:void(0);   Quote Of course, we aware that liquidity on the internal Bitshares marketplace is low. However as we can see it's increasing daily, but according the historical details CVCOIN rate was dropped under 1,5 BTS for very short period, but it is just a tech corrrection like on every market Total buy orders in DEX for CVCOIN is arround $1.500-2.500.What increase are you talking about ?   Quote Based on the our schedule, we have prepared a lot of updates and were going to publish at this week, including the start of official trading support on Bitshares DEX, but due of the processing the distribution of ALPHA version, we have to move it on the next week.  Without informing the community about it again ?  Quote We are hurry to introduce you the first mobile and most secure Bitshares wallet  integrated in the most secure communication app. How do you find, would it give value of CVCOIN ? Bitshare has a very small community and is not very well liked by the majority.Its basicly traded in asia  Quote We have more than 8000 members and arround 3500 real investors. Why there are not trading yet or dropping the coins ? The reason is simple - the major holders of CVCOIN is smart enough and awaiting to the great live products and safe exchanges which give the real value of the token. Or maybe because there are no buy orders to who they could sell their coins without a big loss  Quote But everything in our hand. Together with OpenLeger team we will do our best to make it convenient, liquid and free of tech issues, since we beleive that the future of trades belongs to DEX.  So, instead of continuously claiming about these issues, we expect from our communities to support this idea and work together to make it popular, bring new opportunities of secure trading to the world.  This statement makes me fear most since i clearly read here a intensiv longterm cooperation between CVCoin and Openledger and that CVCoins success is dependent on Openledger .There was no info about that on the whitepaper but it would make sense why Ronald Kramer from Bitshare and Ronny Boesing from Openledger were Escrow for Crypviser.  There was no information at the ico about this corelation and your roadmap is also in everything a whole month delayed.  Support not replying at all and no public information",False

The pool of miners and big invest groups countroling the price over the tokens.   It is impossible to compare Bitcoin with altcoin, because of Bitcoin has a value as inventor of Blockchain technology and ideas.  As I mentioned before, do we want that or do not, but the time of crypto market regulations is coming. We beleive in this way only tokens backed by real and useful purposes will survive in long - term.  Massivele rising not all, but some of ICOs is mostly due aritificial price manipluations, when CVCOIN volumes is organic. The purpose of any token going to big exchanges with nothing on behind, is pump and breaking down to allow the same 1% of investors earn 1000% of profit. In this way you will claim that Crypviser team deceived investors and earned more money for themself.  We do no not think this is will make happy our minor investors, which are the 70% of the total funders. We tryting to act on behalf of whole community and allow them to give the real value.  Have a look what's going on with Bitcoin Cash - this is the best demonstration how is clon, which has been moved in front of the biggest exchanges. But it doesn't help to keep it's value and became 'speculative' token instantly. Well, of course group of insiders in this case has earned a lot of by dropping down the 80% of it's initial value. In this case after that it could be forgotten regardless where it listed.  Are you sure that's the right way for CVCOIN?

Which means when bitcoin raises altcoin rises even more..However if bitcoin decreases altcoins are decreasing more too. Which means momentum is for an altcoin very important. Crypviser always claimed to join exchanges asap.Which was a great decision so crypviser could gain on the momentum of bitcoins like all other coins do. Should crypviser be added to other exchanges with a bad momentum and a low price like at OL it will be extremly hard to increase price as everything is going down at a bad momentum.Bitcoin just jumped again from 2000-3250 .Altcoins made a great gain on these time by increasing their price and volume.Crypviser however is at a level you could call it a dead coin.Sorry but $1,5k-3k trade volume is nothing.Even dead coins have a higher volume and i'm not saying it to attack crypviser but thats a fact which needs to be changed asap. Please remember crypviser promised us 2 exchanges in july and a buying wall.Nothing happened.I can understand that there may be issues however they should inform about it the community.Next issue is they officaly announced to push CVCoin from 03.augst..... I pushed at that date CVCoin higher in hope when the announcement appears that there will be a nice rise and a nice momentum to attract that coin to other traders. But again not a single word and no information or excuse.I waited on 04.august and nothing again. Their communitcation to the community is just horrible and personly i get the feeling based on their posts and announcement that they want that CVCoin should push Openledger to top with the help of the community.  I have to say clearly i don't like openledger like many other people.Their support just sucks. I lost 200 CVCoins and sent a support ticket with a reply its a bug and nothing more. Another reply from them when asking them something about their system was : ""Please ask the community"" Crypviser has also support issues when seeing how many people are complaining here and when seeing how a friend of mine can't get his 400 coins he bought because of another bug on OL. He just got a reply it will be handled later  There are many communication issues with crypviser at the moment and this is a fact.I don't write it to attack crypviser but in the hope there will be a positiv change.I didnt invested so much money and time into that coin to make it unsuccessfull. There should be a clear announcement how we go on and exectly what is going to happen with exchanges. Once you read that the negotiations with kraken was successfull but later not a single word about it. Their current solution is to increase volume on openledger. But when reading their plan its not going to work.The reason for it is that OL has no big community and with a trade volume of just $10k per 24h CVCoin would be already on the 5th place of highest traded coins on OL.  What makes me also mad is the fact that crypviser had a clear plan and now they changed it and call people who demand to stick to that plan bad people who want to make quick profit causing harm to the crypviser community.  Also i sent a request to get invited to their slack and no reply to that for weeks",False

However, the real price to this point is not good, I really can not predict the future of the coin. We just hope the development team will soon launch CVPay and a new blockchain for CVCoin  I just read a reply from Cryviser on facebook about CVCoin's price issue and he explained quite convincingly  That's not true, false info. Have you checked the current state on the Bitshares DEX ? The trade volumes recently increased 5 times. The current rate is 0,329$ https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/cvcoin/#charts which is just a little lower than ICO price arround 0,39$ But this is an ""internal"" price of BTS marketplace. CVCOIN has been issued just 3 weeks ago and became immedeately tradable. There are no serious volumes yet, nobody should consider it as a real market price and warry about it until going on liquid markets and launching the Crypviser network.  Well, lets discuss a little bit about the value of CVCOIN. Which factors give the real value of any token ?  1. How it's backed, what is behind of token 2. Availability of token for mass market and exchange  If you check you will find that most of the token on coinmarketcap are match only 1 condition - speculative trading on exchanges. BUBBLES Just few token backed with the real technologies and products on demand.  CVCOIN is a token backed with a new generation of cryptograhic and encryption products on demand, that will be used daily hopefully on hundreed of millions devices. CVCOIN will be required for use Crypviser services. Now thing how it may become forgotten ? This is the most important task and we focused on it. The main purpose of Crypviser crowfunding was developing the most secure communication platform, so CVCOIN was not designed for HYPE or BUBBLE. CVCOIN is token of technology like a BTC or ETH.  Speculative trading on the massive exchanges just one of the feature that coming soon definetly. But we are facing too much attention on trading purpose.  Everyone should keep in mind that its not enough just be listed on the big exchange. The TOP 20 most traded tokens are backed with real technologies, and CVCOIN is going to be one of them.

When we are talking about the low liquidity on Bitshares DEX, lets think what is the reason ? We have more than 8000 members and arround 3500 real investors. Why there are not trading yet or dropping the coins ? The reason is simple - the major holders of CVCOIN is smart enough and awaiting to the great live products and safe exchanges which give the real value of the token.  One of the highest priority of Crypviser is secure trading and fund management. This is a reason we carefully choose and advise trading platform to our communities. Considering this opprotunity, in order to stop any further specuIations and ""trolling"", I  would officially confirm, that CVCOIN will be listed one by one on the major and most secure trading platform during the August 2017.  About the reasons why it did not happens in July, I would bring to your kind attention the below simple and clear reasons.  1. BTC SegWit deals and hard fork 2. Unclear and turbulent situation with the big exchanges 3. The delays (not related to us) with the exchanges staff caused by summer season.  The CVCOIN ICO was on of the fairest ICO crowfunding available and affordable to everyone, not like a some ""corporate ICOs"" called to laundering money for big corporations. As you can see regardless statuses and position we are one with our communities and working as one team. Bitshares platform is different than other ones, but the most important advantage it's utilyzing the main values of Blockchain technologies - decentralization, trust and freedom. At least you can sleep peacefully and do not worry about safety of your funds with Crypviser. In the same time we recongnize and understand the current issues of Bitshares DEX - the lack of liquidity and popularity. But everything in our hand. Together with OpenLeger team we will do our best to make it convenient, liquid and free of tech issues, since we beleive that the future of trades belongs to DEX.  So, instead of continuously claiming about these issues, we expect from our communities to support this idea and work together to make it popular, bring new opportunities of secure trading to the world.  Yes, we have great community, if each member doesn't hesititate to share info about Bitshares DEX & CVCOIN, then we will grow rapidly day - by - day and benefit all together.  Although we focused on DEX, once again I would confirm that we will see CVCOIN listed on the major classic exchanges during August 2017 and supported with real live products! We found this the best way to move ahead on behalf of our investors and funders.  Thank you for attention and have nice weekend! Follow us and keep safe.  Cheers.",False

We take this chance to remind all of our existing and potential investors that we have made two strategically crucial decisions.  Now it is clear that creating CVCoin on the Bitshares platform was the right move. It is both secure for CVCoin holders as well as for Crypviser and offers a bright future. Making a token ETH-based is not as good as it used to be. The world is changing and so should we.  Regarding the exchange: We know some CVCoin holders find it difficult to trade on Bitshares. It is a decentralized exchange and indeed differs from centralized exchanges such as Bittrex, Poloniex and... BTC-E. Nevertheless, recent news show us that Bitshares is a much more secure solution. We are not saying that we stop cooperating with ""classic"" big exchanges.

On openledger you can cash out for half price on your investment. When CVC coin is listed on exchanges it will be more i think (depends on the tsunami timing). Like cashing out on your investment. But i like this project because its unique. If the app is stable and easy in use there will be demand for it. Espacialy in certain countries. When this is live and users grow, then you know you have a very sweet deal for now.  I am not a big boy and did hope (like others) the ICO exchange launch is dubble. We will see, but I support the project and keep my coins (unless i can get tripple on the exchanges, but don't think so).  So it is cashing out low or waiting on the project succes and get nice ROI. Like earlier said in te form. It will take a lot of time and that is better for the app development.  Crypviser team, i wish you the very best in the development and i believe its gone be nice!

I used the download version.. but I believe it also stores a web version so you can access it everywhere..  It was actually really easy as I recall, all of the registration happens right in the wallet when you open it.  There are about 30 different coins on the wallet.. and its a decentralized exchange..  so YOU own your coins at all times.  And yes.. you can trade the coins within the wallet.. that's kinda the point of the built in exchange I think..   I'm pretty sure you can just sign up through the open ledger website if you don't want to download anything.. but I like having a physical backup of my wallet files.

Obviously a scam project would not hesitate to tell the investors the total coin supply. So you are probably not a scam project. So i guess it is because of number 4.

The ICO campaign will conclude today at 22.00 UTC.  Crypviser plans to list CVCoins on public markets at the initial rate of 0.99 EUR for each CVCoin token. The proposed purpose of the token is to use them to cover the charges of Blockchain transactions for their payments system, as well as for using them for authentication purposes for their messenger.  Crypviser announces move away from Ethereum Network In the last week of the recently concluded ICO, Crypviser, through a Facebook post, announced that they would be moving away from the Ethereum network due to the problems experienced on the Ethereum Blockchain.  Crypviser announced: “Crypviser concerns about recent problems within Ethereum network and sees the current situation as unreliable and business critical for our project. The speed of transactions for the authentication system is too important to be disregarded.” They further elaborated that since their application would be used by millions of clients globally they would to bring “superb quality solutions to the market” and one of the crucial factors for them was “maximum speed of transactions.”  Ethereum network speed issues have been coming in the way of many ICOs that have based themselves on its Blockchain. We talked with Jon Holmquist, founder of PRX, which is the first and an experimental ICO on the Ripple Blockchain.  Holmquist discussed the alternatives to Ethereum:  “There are a lot of decentralized currency projects out there at this point that are vying to find a solution to an actual problem currently facing the world. One big, current issue, is issuing tokens. ICOs are currently the craze in the crypto space. I wouldn't be too surprised if more networks that allow anyone to distribute assets start pushing for some of the ICO volumes that were historically Ethereum's.”  Token distribution post-ICO In another announcement on Facebook, Crypviser announced their intent to carry out a token distribution post-ICO. They will be keeping the capitalization unchanged and will be distributing all unsold CVCoins to investors. It would mean, in lay terms, that investors will be getting yet more CVCoins after the crowdsale is over. It would also make investors on the exchanges the majority stakeholders in Crypviser.  The formula that Crypviser is proposing is K=1+NS/S, where NS represents all unsold coins and S represents sold coins. They are citing an example that implies that if you had 1,000 CVCoins priced at EUR 940 (after a five percent discount), after the ICO you will receive 2,200 CVC instead of 1,000.  CVCoin will be traded on BitShares DEX stocks and are also expected to be traded on Livecoin and C-Cex. According to Crypviser, they are in negotiations currently with Kraken and Bittrex as well.  An alternative in the BitShares Blockchain? As for Crypviser, they are moving to the BitShares Blockchain. The Facebook post from them indicated:  “We have decided to move on with Bitshares blockchain. This platform has already proven its sustainability for tens of projects and is able to proceed up to 100,000 transactions per second. CVCoin tokens are to be issued soon and all Crypviser investors will receive instructions concerning registration within Bitshares network. On July, 7 all the tokens will be distributed among its holders.”  The BitShares Blockchain promises a faster speed and is capable of 100,000 transactions per second. They claim that they can process more transactions each second than Visa and Mastercard combined.  Different strokes for different folks In the case of Crypviser, where the main product is a secure messenger, which requires transactions to be executed faster and in a secure manner, the move away from Ethereum makes sense.  Similarly, other ICOs may require different services from a Blockchain and may adopt a Blockchain that serves their purpose. It is quite clear that the ICO phenomenon is not something limited to Ethereum or unique to them.  As Kumar Gaurav, chairman of the Auxesis Group, says:  “The good thing is that we are at such an early stage that we can have many different Etheruems. Ripple, Lisk, Auxledger, there are many public Blockchain fabrics on the way and they are getting more and more optimized as per the requirements and learning from the failures from the previous public Blockchains. Also, given the political situation, maybe there will be a need for nation-specific Blockchain solutions such as having national ID, budgets, defense, benefit distribution data, etc, and these applications will give birth to specialized chains.”  Gaurav’s Auxesis Group is planning to create 600 nodes of its Auxledger hosted in government data centers which will allow entrepreneurs to create applications on top of it, especially its application where data privacy becomes legal and of national interest.  In the long-run, the move to BitShares will help Crypviser to provide genuine encryption key identification that will stymie any manipulation, interception or man-in-the-middle attacks, effectively providing better privacy and security for their clients.  | JOIN ICO |  Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypviser-moves-to-bitshares-blockchain-ditching-ethereum-in-process via @Cointelegraph",False

So i have to following questions:  1. What is the total coin supply? 2. Is it fixed or inflationary? If inflationary, how does the inflation work and how is the distribution of the new coins regulated? 3. Is there one ICO round with 15 000 000 CVC coins to distribute or will there be more rounds? 4. How many coins will be withheld by the development team? 5. How many coins will be withheld by other parties (like early investors/supporters etc.)? 6. Does the CVC coin as a token have a function in your blockchain? In other words is the coin needed in the network to facilitate the communication?

Tokens distribution. It was difficult for us to go for it. We had to consider both investors and Crypviser interests. And we have decided to lower our stake in the project and keep capitalization unchanged. This decision makes our investors and coin holders key players on market. We are going to distribute all the UNSOLD CVCoins among our investors. So every investment will be multiplied by a specific coefficient which will depend on the number of coins left. This move will make our participants the main investors on exchanges after ICO is finished. Even buying CVC now will bring you much more profit than if you buy afterwards. Formula: K=1+NS/S NS = unsold coins S = sold coins For example Crypviser sells 4,500,000 tokens, i.e. 5,500,000 unsold. Then: 5.5 / 4.5 + 1 = 2.22 ============================================================ Example 1: You take 1,000 CVC Current price = 940 EUR (5% discount). After ICO is over you get 2,220 CVC instead of 1,000 CVC. Consider you bought 1 CVC for 0.42 EUR, i.e. 58% discount. ============================================================ Example 2: You take 7,000 CVC Current price: 6,385.5 Including 10% bonus: 7,700 CVC After ICO is over you get 17,094 CVC instead of 7,700 CVC. Consider you bought 1 CVC for 0.37 EUR, i.e. 63% discount. ============================================================ We remind that CVCoin will be traded on all Bitshares DEX stocks and its expected to be traded at Livecoin, C-cex exchanges. Currently we negotiate with Kraken and Bittrex exchanges as well. Still you have few days till June, 30 to join our ICO and increase your stake.

One such movement is being championed by Crypviser for Blockchain encryption.  THE NEED TO PROTECT DATA  Data is who we are. We are social security numbers, credit scores, and passport numbers. We are social media users, ecommerce consumers, and medical patients. To computers, to companies, and to governments, these data are what make up individuals and groups. This is why it is so important to protect your data, because it means you are protecting you.  With the incessant attacks on net neutrality and consumer data protection laws, coupled with criminal attacks on personal data, protecting data has never been more important. If you do not already, please take this as an opportunity to start.  WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF  VPNs A VPN is a Virtual Private Network. What this does is it extends a private network over a public network, essentially meaning that those connected to the VPN could be able to file share and interact with other nodes of the VPN as if it were on a local network.   These are used for secure connections and circumventing geolocative restriction. Some exit nodes dump out traffic in a country with very strict internet privacy laws to further protect their users.  Often these cost money, and if you have a free one they might be selling your information or your connection as an exit node -so any dumped traffic would look like it came from your connection, which could be problematic-. Some VPN providers can have outdated protocols and others are just not that secure at all. The fact that there are any that still save traffic logs is in and of itself worrying.  Also the United States has ruled that by simply running a VPN you could be subject to having a warrant issued in your name. VPNs are one of the most common and useful ways to protect yourself, but they are not infallible.  TSL/SSL TSL and SSL -usually only referred to as SSL- are cryptographic protocols that secure connections between two or more computing applications. Email, instant messaging, and Voice over IP (VoIP) all use some sort of SSL to secure data integrity and some level of privacy.   There have been many attacks against SSL protocols and these have shown the security exploits that can be used to undermine the privacy and data integrity of its users.  Crypviser Crypviser is a project that aims to shake up the way we think about information security for ourselves and for business. They will offer both social and business solutions to encrypt and protect not only the data and content being exchanged, but also the privacy of the individuals.  Their messenger feature will allow for completely private and anonymous text, voice, and video chatting backed up by the blockchain and stellar encryption.  They will also be developing CVPay as a native part of their service. This allows for the transfer of funds -via CVCoin, their token- in a similarly private and secure way.  Files within the Crypviser ecosystem will also enjoy the same robust security that is afforded to chats and payments. Even if a device is physically damaged or compromised, the files will remain encrypted and safe.  Protecting yourself means protecting your data. Take the time to review how you go about your personal infosec, then improve those.   https://themerkle.com/this-is-a-reminder-to-check-how-well-you-protect-your-data/ #crypviser #cvcoin #ico",False

Just have a look CVC is only known at bitcointalk and nowhere else.Some articles here and there but nohting more. Their livestream a total mess.Did you watched it ?At peak time 30 watchers and after 2 1/2 a total view of 480. Their youtube channel and main clip just 7000 views. Its not known at other messageboards or groups. They just advertise on bitcointalk. Like i predicted they will just sell arround 2-3 million coins at ICO which means they need to sell 7 million more coins at a price of 0.99 EUR before the price can go up. This means the price will be not rising for months and Crypviser is going to loose the time bonus of ATH from bitcoin . I offered them my help in exchange of some coins.I already showed them how to get attention in public to sell these 10.000.000 coins quickly but they are ignorant that its shocking. They call themself professionals however they don't even know reality in the internet demanding staff which is nearly impossible.  Please have a look how much money they spend for BS promotion.Signature = bitcointalk ,posting = bitcointalk , translation = bitcointalk,newsletter=bitcointalk ,posting on facebook account = untargeted traffic not interrested in crypto since crypto is still a small community compared to the rest .They claim they have a marketing expert but watching the result is just horrible. Have a look at their fanpage.A cute girl gets more subscribers in a week then they did.No social media attention at all.  Come on guys their coin seems to be good but their marketing sucks high ten.Have a look at orogold.Nearly no advertisement and has as many money raised like this coin even its called a scam coin.

We decided to remind them as well as our answers.   1) THE BEST FINANCIAL QUESTION Q: What role had CVCoin in Crypviser messenger? Why can't you use 10 EUR in ETH and made our own?  A: CVCoin will be issued as a currency of Crypviser Network for covering transaction fees of the blochain authentication (public key distribution) algorithmes. In Crypviser messenger it will be used as a currency for paying subscription fees of premium plans with enabled public key distribution through Blockchain.  The authentication algorithmes used in Crypviser requires a very high speed of executing the transaction and providing confirmation. So, this is a reason why it's not possible technically to use ETH or another cryptocurrencies, because of the blockchains they are based are not suitable for instant communication purposes.  CVCoin will be issued on the most powerfull and fast blockchain Bitshares and integrated into the Crypviser apps.   2) THE BEST TECH QUESTION Q: What encryption methods will be used for data transmission? Why is not enough standard methods of encryption applied on the web?  A: The current security and encryption models of the most popular instant communication platforms are centralized and do not match the modern security challenges. The open (public) keys generation and distribution process, necessary for data encryption, as well as user (client) authorization on the server, performed on the service provider side. This is a big ""hole"" and vulnerability, which allows an easy interception and manipulation of user's data.   Beside that the standard encryption methods mostly used in common social and business networks, such as AES - 256 chipher, HASH - 2 and etc are outdated and already have been compromised several times.  Crypviser uses the most advanced, unbeatable and fast encryption algorithmes, such as stream chepher SALSA 20/20, SHA-3 512, Eliptic Curve cryptograpy along with disruptive public key distribution (authnetication) based on Blockchain.   3) THE BEST GENERAL (DEVELOPMENT) QUESTIONS Q1: What does this 01000011 01010110 01000011 figure means on your coin Icon???  A1: 01000011 01010110 01000011 - is a digital Abbreviation of CVCoin. It means that on the ""computer"" language 'CVCoin' looks like  '01000011 01010110 01000011'  Q2: Hello! The question is the following: on the logo the CVCOIN coin looks very original. Will such coins be produced from metal and be distributed among those who wish?Thanks in advance!  A2: Yes, we have planned to issue limited cap of real CVCoin in metal - bronze, as well as with gold, platine or maybe with another precious materials exclusively. They will be available for sell in online - shops for digital CVCoin and distributed for free during the live meetings and conferences,  as souvenirs for gratitude to the best supporters and investors of CVCoin community.",False

There was a misunderstanding. Now you can get the coins here at http://ico.crypviser.net. In case not coins are cold, after ICO they can be bought only through exchanges at nominal rate 0.99 EUR. Hope it makes sense now.  This is not clear for me, so what will happend with the coins which will not be sold at the ico end? The Company behind the cvc coin will sell this coins to 0,99EUR at the exchanges till all coins are sold? In this case the ico has not really ended, it is just a new platform. It feels like a open price manipulation because the price has no chance to grow till all coins the company holds are sold out.  To prevent such a case normally there is a fixed ico start/end a cap and a process what will happen if not all coins/token are sold. The solutions normally used are burn or a percentual distribution to all holders.  Can someone of the crypvisor team please make a statement to this topic? At the moment there are round about 1.2Mio CVC sold, if we think positiv they get up to 3 Mio CVC till the ico ends. After this you will sell another 7 Mio CVC via exchanges in the next months or years if the demand is low? If this come true this is one of the worst crypto investments of the last years.  regards",False

It would be nice if you could reply to it. You guys are making a lot of big mistakes promoting your coin and there are way bigger resources which you haven't even touched.

This will take a long time to sell the rest coins if they won't fix their marketing. The increase of the bounty has no real effect since its still just mainly for people from this board. Cryptviser is limiting themself which is a big mistake which hurts more since it looks it could be a real successfull coin if they would put more effort in marketing or at least listening to some people who have some knowledge about it. There is a possibility to buy PR for just $3k and the word of this coin would spread out to millions of people which would have a great effect expecially at these times where bitcoin is rising.  You guys really need to listen to some people who have knowledge about marketing a coin and stop acting like every other unsuccessfull coin . Your FB bounty as example is a joke.You know that there are fb account farms who owns thousands of accounts with fake friends etc.....  Like i said if you want to be your coin successfull get a guy who knows about marketing since marketing at the beginning is way more important than your coin itself,False

Crypviser is the first encrypted network for social and business communication based on the Blockchain.  Crypviser is currently in the process of conducting a crowdsale initial coin offering (ICO) for its token CVCoin, which is due to end on June 30, 2017. The CVCoin token would be used by Crypviser to cover the charges of Blockchain transactions, which are required for authentication purposes. The authentication process on the Blockchain would ensure that users of Crypviser enjoy the highest level of security in an end-to-end encrypted messenger.   The team behind Crypviser  Crypviser is a disruptive messenger product, and the people behind Crypviser are all professionals who have a high degree of experience. Vadim Andryan, the founder, CEO and CTO of Crypviser, has a military and government project background where he worked on cyber security and social engineering projects.  Andryan has founded telecom companies that are operational globally. He holds CCNA and CCNP degrees in IT security and cryptography. Waldemar Konradi is the co-founder and director and he has substantial experience in the telecom industry. In the past, Konradi has worked for Euphony GmbH as a sales manager.  He has also worked for Enete GmbH as an executive director. Victor Gubin, the lead developer, has had a focus on mobile devices kernel and is a leading Android developer as well as a software engineer.   Crypviser in the midst of a successful ICO  The Crypviser ICO, as of the time of writing, has raised €864,012. Crypviser plans to spread the bulk of the ICO proceeds towards mobile development (55 percent), backend development (15 percent), infrastructure (10 percent), licensing fees (seven percent), legal services (three percent), operational costs (five percent) and marketing (five percent).  Investors have the opportunity to get bonus CVCoin tokens for being early birds at the ICO. In week three of the ICO, which is due to end on June 10, 2017, investors will receive 15 percent bonus tokens.  The plan is to distribute 15 mln CVCoins. CVCoin investors receive a wide range of benefits for investing in the project. These benefits range from free subscriptions, access to hidden features, free access to the CVPay system, a bonus program, among other things. The messenger will come with the CVPay integrated so that users can send each other money in the form of CVCoin securely, instantly, anonymously and reliably.

The Blockchain has granted us many new exciting opportunities to improve the way that we do business and socialize with one another. The beauty and elegance of Blockchain technology security is one of the most attractive things for innovation. One of the latest projects looking to implement Blockchain technology into more aspects of daily life is from Germany, called Crypviser.  WHAT IS CRYPVISER?  Crypviser is an encrypted network work that is based off Blockchain technology for both social and business protection. It is a network for securely storing and transferring all manner of data, including voice and video calls, various chats, and other kinds of social and business interactions.  Their Whitepaper outlines how very aware the project is of information security needing to be improved upon. Crypviser also wants this caliber of security product to be available to everyone, not just governments and giant corporations.  WHAT ARE ITS FEATURES?  The main focus of this project is to provide a better security product for businesses and individuals. It is no surprise that the first feature they advertise is their incredibly secure network, backed up by robust cryptography and security models powered by reliable algorithms and security protocols.  Continuing on that point, the fact that it is backed up by the blockchain means that the network itself is stable and reliable. It also means that Crypviser’s network is less vulnerable to identity theft and MiTM attacks.  It also touts itself as an all-in-one solution to both business and social communication infosec needs. It does this while still allowing local storage security and protecting against data loss from physical damage or malicious software.  CVCOIN AND CVPAY  Another aspect about Crypviser is that it has an integration for their wallet service, CVPay which allows for anonymous and fast transfer of funds via CVCoin.  CVCoin’s main purpose is an authentication token, which identifies user’s public keys to ensure that the network is stable and secure. It also acts as a way to pay for the products that Crypviser provides without having to hand over sensitive information like credit card numbers and other identifying information. Since users can pay in CVCoin to Crypviser, they have promised that within network 1 CVC will never be valued lower than 0.99 Euro, regardless of public market price.  They are having an ICO of this asset right now as well that ends on June 30th. It appears to have a fair amount of attractive offers as well, such as an extra 10% of CVCoin and an invitation to the official launch of the product. Investors can purchase in XBT, ETH, and then any cryptocurrency really -converted to XBT or ETH via Shapeshift or other converter-.  THE FUTURE  Crypviser already has their eyes set on the future of the project as well, as their roadmap clearly lays out. With all going well, they plan on having the official launch in early September with their commercial launch happening soon after as well.

Please see below the financial milestones of the reised amounts. This plan has been approved by Escrow and they will withdraw the funds according it.      PHASE I â€“  initial 15% (after distribution of tokens) OBJECTIVES:  FUNDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALPHA STAGE (UP TO 100 USERS) TARGET: Release of full-featured applications for IOS and Android platforms, ready to be launched in Alpha mode (without the CVPay module)   PHASE II â€“ 30%  OBJECTIVES: PREPARING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR STARTING A PUBLIC BETA STAGE (UP TO 100.000 USERS)    TARGET: Full-featured releases for IOS and Android platforms, adjusted according on the Alpha test results and ready to be launched in public BETA mode (without CVPay module)     PHASE III  - 25%    OBJECTIVES: DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS VERSIONS FOR ENTERPRISE USERS  TARGET: Releases of mobile and desktop business versions in Alpha mode    PHASE IV -  20%  OBJECTIVES: PREPARING AND STARTING COMMERCIAL VERSIONS FOR B2C AND B2B  (FROM 1 MLN. USERS AND MORE) TARGET: Release of full-featured applications for iOS and Android platforms, ready  for commercial launch     PHASE V - 15%  OBJECTIVES: DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION OF CVPAY, FURTHER DEVELOPMENT  TARGET: Release of Apps with built-in module for CVPay transfer system and growing further markets      2. I will discuss the current bonus of Bounty with my team and review it in accordance with the community expectations. I agree that to get sold all 10 mln in short time we need get more attention, as well as to promote the future products of Crypviser.   3. The reserved 5 mln, coins will be distributed according the below conditions  1.6 - 3% (in case of review) will be distributed for Bounty  10% - for ICO managing partners, Escrow service, for promotional campaigns, product related and referal bonuses  40% - will be shared by shareholders and core development team (9 persons)  and the rest ~ 47 - 48.4 % will be reserved only for production purposes to serve customers in case if we get more than expected. These coins wil be out of the market and used for deliver commercial products, e.g. monthly subscription plans and paid services.         Quote from: MURONDI on June 01, 2017, 02:07:55 AM Quote from: celot on June 01, 2017, 12:59:10 AM Judging from his dev business, I am sure his iconya will be successful. Yesterday there was a bit of a constraint about CVC and Enchryptotel  What's the problem between crypviser and Enchryptotel ,,?    There is no problem. Just we have received some requests from some members of our community and mass media agents, how is Crypviser different and what are the our advantages.  And the answer is simple. There is nothing to compare at all and nothing to say.  Crypviser is based on the disruptive decentralized blockchain- based authentication model with the genuine end - to end ecnryption scheme, and on the other hand is encryptotel which use is simple TLS/SRTP peer - to - peer cryptography performed on the server side  TLS/SSL is centrlizied encryption which has been in use for the last 25 years and has nothing related to the Blockchain.  That all what can I say about it and beleive everyone involved in cyber - security a little can figure out the huge advantages of END - to - END encryption & blockchain based authentication VS classic TLS/SSL  More over we are talking about absolutely different products. Crypviser is a unified communication platform with brand cross - platform apps based on it's core tehnology. encryptotel is positioning just as a cloud - based PBX. How its related to Blockchain technologies is a puzzle   According their Whitepaper I can bravely they, these guys do not have any ideas and experience about cryptography & encryption, but it seems has very strong marketing! In this way we are different too, we have strong technical expertise and have been working hard on development, but late with marketing   I guess just a way to rise money and honestly I'm sorry for their investors because there are no chance for competition. Thereby they were hurry to launch ICO earlier  More details you can find here www.medium.com/@vadiman/crypviser-vs-encryptotel-no-way-nothing-to-compare-76e78a0a6ec     Hi All !  Just a short update.  More than 830K CVC have been sold.  More than 650K euro raised for now, and there are 30 successful days left  For 20% discount just 3 days left.

It would be nice answering that question since its a bit uncommon that somebody sends an email to your team about promoting your coin and getting a reply what he can do for Polybius.  The next question would be what exectly do you do with the money you collect for 10.000.000 coins ?  Also why is the bounty for promoting that coin so low ? Its like promotion gets 1.6% (btw your bounty page is wrong since it claims its 1.5% but if you count all bounties together its 1.6%) and the dev team like 90% ?Which contractors will get rest of the funds ?

Public key authentication is the most important stage in every cryptography model to ensure that the keys belong to the real owner.  Through disruptive Blockchain based transactions, Crypviser provides genuine encryption key identification to prevent any kind of manipulation, interceptions and “Man in the Middle” (MiTM) attacks on all communication levels.  Product Related Currency CVCoin is the world’s first product-related cryptocurrency of state-of-the-art encryption technology. It allows users to pay for Crypviser services and monthly subscriptions anonymously, allowing them not to disclose payment information, such as credit card or bank account details. CVCoins are available for sale on BTC, ETH and can be exchanged for a wide range of currencies provided by the ShapeShift exchange.  The Currency Value The initial exchange rate of CVCoin is related to the base monthly subscription of Crypviser Network and equal 0,99 EUR for 1 CVCoin. Within the Crypviser Network the exchange rate of 1 CVC always will be not less than 0,99 EUR, regardless the public market price  Investment Possibilities During the ICO campaign CVC can be purchased with attractive discounts up to 30%. After the market launch of the Crypviser Network your purchased coins can then be sold to other Crypviser customers at nominal exchange rate. Upon completion of the ICO campaign, CVCoin will become available on all main stock markets. We expect that the market rate of CVCoin will rapidly grow along with  capacity of the Crypviser Network.  The Future At the market launch CVC are going to be introduced as the currency of the Crypviser Network. In the future our team is working on CVC to bring it as a reliable unit of money exchange on established global e-commerce platforms.
