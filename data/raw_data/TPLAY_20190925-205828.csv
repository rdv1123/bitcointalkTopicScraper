I have a problem with this project, I will begin my story  I signed up at fairplay.io casino and received a bonus for confirming my email 100 TPLAY. (About $ 20)  I managed to win and run a wager for this bonus.  Then I made a deposit of 49.00 TPLAY (this is necessary to get my winnings) and requested a withdrawal. Then I went through a full check of my documents on the website trueplay.io  It took 3 days and the casino refused to pay the winnings in full volume, referring to paragraph 4.7 of the rules, but at the time of my registration this item was not. My claim is that the casino has changed its rules in order not to pay me a win.

TruePlay is a dynamic Blockchain-as-a-Service platform for online gambling. So, we will be just happy to shed some light on what is gaining popularity in online gambling now.  1. Mobile platforms This seems not surprising at all as, according to statistical data, the number of smartphone users may be roughly equal to 2.53 bln users by the end of 2018!  We in TruePlay cannot but keep abreast of the current situation so we are developing user-friendly mobile applications for both iOS and Android at the moment. You can be assured your TruePlay is always at your fingertips wherever you go.  2. Live dealers Although this idea may seem a bit strange at first glance, in further consideration it becomes clear that this is a meaningful feature. This innovation is worth the salt because it brings more life into virtual rooms, which are nothing but an imitation of real-time casino parlors.  Truth be told, it is not a real gimmick as this way of socializing iGambling has been into play since 2006 — almost negligible at most times.  3. E-sports betting Even an amateur prophet will handle foreseeing the future of this sphere: it is expected to have rocketed by the end of 2020. One needs to know that only 3 games are considered worthy: Counter Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends and DotA 2.  4. Brand slots We all know how badly people love things that are a. popular; b. branded. iGambling is no exception. Games featuring characters and scenery of illustrious ‘Westworld’ or ‘Game of Thrones, for example, have more chances to win players’ hearts.  5. VR/AR It is only natural to at least question the opportunity of applying AR or VR to online gambling: this ‘fantastic’ extra has caused a great stir! However, things are not that neat cause such a service has tough technical requirements both on side of the player and of the gambling platform itself.  On the other hand, with the development of technologies conditions are forecast to become better while equipment — cheaper, which will, in turn, lead to an increase in number of VR/AR gambling platforms.  6. Blockchain It goes without saying that this technology is the sole way to gamble and stay safe and sound given the transparent nature of Blockchain.  What is more: a. iGambling market is constantly increasing. b. There have occurred positive changes in legal regulations recently.  In regard to all that, online gambling seems quite a promising business direction. But, of course, it depends on the main players to a large extent.  So, we in TruePlay are doing our best to get into the act of innovating and enhancing online gambling.    You can learn more here: https://trueplay.io",False

We in TruePlay position our decentralized platform as a truly innovative pack of separate solutions for online gambling.  And that is not the end to what we offer to our clients and partners: there is also SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-service), either of which aims at facilitating your business operations in iGambling.  However, to avoid making unfounded claims, we find it necessary to do analysis of what our competitors do. So that you could come up with a decision of your own.  Let us compare TruePlay’s functionality with that of our nearest rivals.  They include Decent.Bet, Edgeless and Fun Fair.  We assume that the following criteria — the most essential components — should be assessed:  - successful Token Sale;  - digital Wallet availability;  - MVP;  - fully functional User Account;  - number of games on display;  - developed Casino Management Module.  We shall start with Decent.Bet. What we get to realize is that they have not launched their Token Sale yet, though they do have an MVP with a ready-to-use Wallet and User Account as well as Casino Management Module. Unfortunately, Decent.Bet cannot boast of a numerous variety of games at the moment as there are 3 only, to the best of our knowledge.  Now let us move on to our next peer, which is Edgeless. As we can ascertain, they duplicate the previous ICO’s story. As well as Fun Fair.  To us in TruePlay, such neglection of their current and potential users’ interests in terms of games — the main requirement of any gambler — seems strange, to the very least.  As opposed to our competition, we in TruePlay have payed specific attention to games. So far, despite the fact that we are also on the MVP stage, we have ‘cooked’ as many as 92 games. We hope that to be enough to satisfy every user’s gambling needs. It is also worth mentioning that among these games are quite complex ones — you can play poker, blackjack, casino and even lottery games!  Not only we provide our own on-site games but we also look forward to integrating off-site providers’ games onto our Blockchain-fueled platform.  We would like to add to that highly convenient multiplatform capabilities that enable players to do what they cherish most across all popular browsers — not to forget about mobile platforms (Android and iOS).  There are many other state-of-the-art features on TruePlay that get security, fairness and convenience of online-gambling rocketing.  They are, for instance, TruePlay Honesty Control system based on RNG (Random Number Generator), TruePlay High-Performance Blockchain and TruePlay CDN.  To top it all, we have already launched 2 Whitelabel projects and are not going to stop on that! And also we have got a Private Token Sale ahead of us — and an Early Sale to be announced soon.  Keep following the news, and we will pleasantly surprise you, shortly.    You can learn more here: https://trueplay.io",False

We are sure you keep asking friends what TruePlay is up to — and searching for updates on the Net.  Sorry for falling out of touch for a while. We believe this is offset by further good news we are cooking for you, this very moment.  As you may remember, TruePlay represents software-as-a-service or Blockchain-as-a-service. We will get back to it in one of our future publications.  So, currently our technical team are working on developing our software while our management team are away on a roadshow in the United States of America.  Here is a list of the top-class ICO-events we have attended so far: Ethereal Summit Consensus 2018 — CoinDesk Token Summit III  Let us elaborate a bit on that and consider what these happenings are about.  First things first. Ethereal Summit has happened to be quite an interesting two-day conference held on May, 11 — May, 12 in NYC. Bringing together more than 30 speakers, it has given us an opportunity to gain knowledge from creditable company founders, executive directors, and team leads from all over the world.  As for Consensus 2018 — CoinDesk, it was the fourth annual Blockchain technology summit, that took place in May, 14–16, and featured well above 250 speakers from various interest groups.  Now let us bring Token Summit III to light. It is the first event providing a deep look into the TBE (Token-Based Economy). We have acquired knowledge from a wide array of recognized pros there, which included business executives, fund managers, finance professionals, lawyers, and many others.  No doubt, these occasions have not been a waste of time as we have taken full advantage of the chance to mingle with true connoisseurs of TBE and ICOs. And have taken useful advice from them.  Yet, this is not the end to our business trips. We have several more conferences on our agenda. They are, as follows: The Next Web BlockShow Europe 2018  This time, all the action will have shifted to Europe.  BlockShow Europe is aimed at bridging the gap between the European market of Blockchain solutions and the Global one.  The Next Web, located in Amsterdam, will last for 2 days and will gather more than 15,000 attendees.  We are expecting to listen to plenty of new stories, take part in Q&A sessions — planned ones coupled with impromptu — and meet with all comers.  So, we welcome all of you who are interested on Blockchain-based businesses, new technologies and global prospects of the sphere — and TruePlay’s further changes — at these upcoming events.

Not only are we passionate about solving tech problems, typical for today’s online gambling. We are also longing for:  - making our online-gambling eco-system a much safer place than it used to be before; - changing the overall image of online gambling.  There are 4 main cornerstones of TruePlay that truly matter: 1. Security; 2. Speed; 3. Convenience; 4. Quality.  Here is a list of things we in TruePlay can guarantee to our current and potential users, as well as investors:  1. Security  - TruePlay Payment Gate minimizing risks of fraud with instant payments via Smart Contracts; - TruePlay Wallet allowing for convenient and fast payments using TPLAYs — our own tokens; - Reduced costs for KYC/AML; - Honesty Control system enabling a user to check their bet result on any stage and ensuring its invariability.  2. Speed  - CDN (Content Delivery Network) making use of Blockchain to decentralize resources and speed up even highly-loaded transactions; - TruePlay Financial Reserve helping out gambling operators in paying winnings irrespective of their size — in an instant.  3. Convenience  - Unified integration making use of a single API and facilitating new games’ inclusion for an operator; - Single-time authorization with a unified TruePlay login giving access to all projects from the platform’s marketplace; - World-wide access in every spot of the world — even in the ones with low Internet connection; - Our own crypto-tokens — as well as other popular crypto-coins — available for any kind of payment on the platform.  4. Quality  - Large volume of top-notch game content from providers of the whole planet; - Transparent affiliate program giving operators an ability to exchange players with exhausted life cycles; - Game statistics, true, complete — straight from the game provider; - TruePlay APK with an SDK for Android and PC for high-quality content on your favourite devices.  Now let us take a look at a bigger picture.  Long-terms global effects include: - Expanding the gambling audience; - Providing more flexibility and bigger opportunities for every market participant; - Raising people’s trust in credibility of the system and the whole gambling industry of the 21st century.  We bet it is not the limit. If you not only want to know how gambling will look like in future but also want to be the change in itself — join us asap.

This is the name of our eco-system. Or, alternatively, a decentralized b2b platform on Blockchain, which provides various tools to facilitate gambling and create a safe and secure environment.  In other words, it is a package solution for gamblers, developers, operators and other market participants. We are happy to boast: our MVP is already on market, and there is a FairPlay project launched by our partners from Gamingtec. This system works on nothing but TruePlay’s solutions, which is a success. And, of course, this would have never been possible without our core team. You have already met a few of them, but we believe that their effort and commitment — as well as outstanding hard work, are worth mentioning once again (though you might have already met some of them at international conferences they attended with TruePlay).  Our visionary is CEO of the company. His name is Oleksiy Mageramov and he has more than 15 years of commercial experience. Also, he is one of the two founders of a software company that was open in 2008. Given it all, plus his 2 degrees in Business and Law, it is only natural he is at the helm of TruePlay. Currently, he is in charge of: - putting vision into practice; - overall goal-setting; - strategic planning and business development.  Another essential figure in TruePlay is Stanislav Makarchuk, who is our CTO. He is quite well-versed in the field of gambling, with his first gambling project launched in 2002. To add to that, he has all the necessary technical expertise and may even be entitled ‘Gambling Evangelist of the CIS’.  We are also proud to have Dmitriy Shvets among our tops. This seasoned VC investor and entrepreneur, majoring in early investment, acts as VC and management consulting expert in TruePlay.  One more man of importance of our team is COO, which stands for Chief Operations Officer. Oleksii Ragozin has more than 6 years of experience in his field and has been forwarding our project to realization since its very start.  We cannot help mentioning our Blockchain architect Rodion Besedin, with him being a super activist is his second job. Nikita Rogoviy, our Head of Programming, is equally vital for TruePlay’s development.

TruePlay is a considerably young project. Yet, we take pride in what we’ve achieved with our project so far, and understand how important it is for our partners and investors to understand where are we going and how we are planning on getting there.  2018  One of our main targets for the year is to get PCI-DSS certification.  Q1 is filled with new goals, and hopefully — accomplishments.  Firstly, we are now testing our our brand new Web App for TruePlay Wallet.  We announced the recent launch of Fairplay.io. (first project from Gamingtec — done with just TruePlay’s gaming-software solutions), but we are also not stopping there and are planning on a lot more to come.  We also are planning on a attending a round of events, the list of which you can find on our website. Let us know is you are attending as well and let’s meet!  As for Q2, it would be mostly run-up time as we are cooking something awesome for you… While planning to propel TruePlay to the next level.  At this stage we will be rolling up our sleeves — in pursuit of the key goal of ’18. Don’t worry, you’ll learn more when the time’s right — just keep checking in with us.  Likewise, it will be time to take the first steps in our own Blockchain design and development. First off, we will start working with documentation and necessary toolware.  Hopefully, we will see ourselves high up on stock exchange listings, too.  By the start of Q3, we hope to have brought our prepping to a close. And start undergoing PCI-DSS certification.  In parallel with it, we will go on developing Blockchain of TruePlay and integrating 3rd-party games into the platform.  We also want to treat our players to network-wide jackpots with prize pools and bet ranges.  By the way, in Q3 it will be possible to address TruePlay Support with questions of all sorts and get valuable help.  We hope Q4 will be the time to harvest the fruits. Among these will be the Beta version of our own Blockchain, full-scale functionality testing of our platform and tournaments — on the one hand. And the much-wanted PCI-DSS certificate — on the other.  2019  By Q1 we have brought homegrown Blockchain on the commercial side, with new TruePlay Affiliate projects within reach through our API.  To top it off, imagine various lottery games on our b2b platform, including Bingo, Keno, Scratch Lottery and others. Yes, we plan on having it all!  No doubt, the rest of 2019 will be no less bright. Pending is our integration into Sportsbook platform and a launch of commercial TruePlay APK.  Ready, steady, go!   You can learn more here: https://trueplay.io",False

According to analysts, the volume of the market will surpass professional sports in a matter of 3–4 years. The latter one is estimated at $130 to $150BLN, which takes into account the sale of broadcasting rights, sponsorship, merchandise and tickets.  At TruePlay, we aim to make the flourishing gambling industry more transparent and reliable for all parties involved. With a unique set of software solutions, we provide licensed gambling companies with top notch, ready-to-use blockchain technologies. We believe that this technology will help bring maximum openness and legality into the online gambling community. In a show of support, numerous existing game providers have already integrated the platform in their successful gambling businesses.  With the help of our platform, users no longer need to monitor transparency or doubt fairness of the game provider — TruePlay provides the level of transparency that allows trustful relationships within the community. Game statistics, for example, allow user to determine whether providers fulfill all generally accepted requirements and regulations, while allowing affiliates to make sure they will be fully paid for the customers they brought in.     Consultants and publishers are given a decentralized structure to access their own game content around the world.

Yet, there are still many issues to tackle. And TruePlay — our new decentralized blockchain-based platform — solves a number of the widespread industry problems and provides a variety of solutions for different stakeholder groups.  Operators  - Financial fraud, including that in payments from stolen plastic cards, is a long-standing issue in the segment. Having no prove of the service provided, 33% of operators had been literally helpless against swindlers, until the blockchain technologies eliminated the risk of financial fraud.  - Operators tend to fear or simply do not want to take the risk of instant payments. It takes time to check documents or ascertain that the origin of the win is legitimate and there is no ongoing fraud. TruePlay Wallet is a payment gateway accepting TPLAY via single protocol. Simplicity and functionality of our API allows for quick implementation of a receipt and rapid expand of the traditional target audience.  Players  - Unfortunately, it is still widely believed that the results of a game in casinos can be fabricated, depending, for instance, on the size of the bet. Such misconception has influenced the image of the gambling industry, forming a negative information field and leading to the lack of trust in the game outcome.  Blockchain technology and preliminary generation of game rounds’ series eliminates the issue by enabling Unique Honesty Control System, allowing players to make sure that the results of the bet are independent.  - Some players prefer to make large bets and usually have to deal with serious difficulties when making payments. They either have to split them up into smaller amounts or provide supporting documentation for each payment. And all this results in wasted time and additional costs.  Now the only deposit limitation our players can face is the balance of their wallet. Using TPLAY makes payments fast and convenient irrespective of their size, so one can bet as much as the heart desires.  Game Providers  - Every provider claims game-content accessibility a ‘front-burner problem’. Our main goal is to achieve maximum technical availability of games, especially for regions with poor internet connection. We dare to say that TruePlay Content Distribution Network allows for easy-to- reach content for its players, wherever they are and however good their Internet connection is.  Webmasters  - They often struggle with delays and curtailment of Partner Payments. And just like operators facing financial frauds, they are nearly always left defenseless against these accidents.  With the use of smart contracts technology, TruePlay can guarantee that Affiliated Rewards to will be fully paid out.  These are issues we are aiming to tackle at a glance only, but rest assured — this is just the tip of the iceberg and we are happy to go deeper — and turn the world of online- gaming technology into a much better place.

At TruePlay, we strongly believe that we are here to foster development of the newest online-gambling technology, that all stakeholders of the market can make use of.  State of the current market  Let us be frank with you: we are not reinventing the wheel, there is a developed online-gambling market, which, according to some recent stats, reached the annual-income level of app. $50B in 2017. Given the stats, it also comes as no surprise that the industry is forecasted to reach $80B in 2018.   Despite quite inspiring stats, though, there are also many issues behind the scenes, which each an every stakeholder of the industry comes across daily. These include high chances of red tape, financial fraud, deficient traffic for newbies, challenges for large deposits and many others.  What we can put on your plate  As our platform has been launched after thorough analysis of the aforementioned issues, we fully intend to solve them.  In putting our money where our mouths are, we have already implemented our MVP and TruePlay Wallet, which allows for easy registration and user authorization, using TruePlay along with external projects, integrating payments in a range of virtual currencies, and much more.  We also have a lot more in store for our stakeholders (to learn more please visit our website for a detailed Road Map).

According to our CEO, Oleksiy Mageramov, this decision comes as a results of increasing interest in TruePlay from big investors. “We’ve decided to allow private investors more time to become a part of the TruePlay family. After that, TPLAY goes on sale for the general public. With TruePlay, it’s never about “potential” — it’s about real life functionality. Private investors saw that we were the first to be integrated into huge, well-known projects, such as PokeDom and a fully licensed casino, FairPlay. They realized that TruePlay is something worth investing in. That’s why our first round of token sale is for them.”  TruePlay was first developed in 2017 by Oleksiy Mageramov, Stanislav Makarchuk and Oleksii Ragozin, who sought to create a truly transparent platform that any gambling project would be able to implement.  TruePlay is its own blockchain-based transaction system that allows for fast token deposits and withdrawals that works across multiple casinos, thus eliminating the headache of long withdrawal periods, surprise commissions based on individual casino’s fees and the overall uncertainty that tainted numerous gambling project’s transactional models.  At the game level, TruePlay publishes a game’s result in HASH before the game begins, sealing the results in a tamper-proof manner, guaranteeing that a game’s results are formulated before the bets are placed on the table.  In terms of gambling affiliates and their relationship with the gambling operator, TruePlay is unique in that it allows for a transparent player ledger, enabling affiliates to see the number of players they brought to the project, their bets, and the commision that results from them.  A unified ecosystem, TruePlay is a modern gambling marketplace with a single, secure authorization, support, deposit and withdrawal mechanism, regardless of the gambling project the player chooses to visit. Its KYC is above those in the financial sector — something the gambling industry has long needed to build trust with its players and affiliates.  Players who buy the token will have access to tens of gambling projects, hundreds of games, and an unprecedented guarantee of transparency and fairness.  Pokerdom — one of the world’s largest online casinos — began accepting (TPLAY) utility tokens from TruePlay.io as payment.  FairPlay.io became the world’s first fully licensed online casino to be based entirely on the TruePlay platform.  TPLAY is currently on sale for private investors.

It’s a readymade solution for gambling projects that’s already being implemented by some of the top industry players. We’re not in this business short term, we’ve been part of the gambling community for over a decade, and we see blockchain as the natural evolution of the industry - an evolution that’s going to be spearheaded by the TruePlay platform. That’s why we’re issuing TPLAY - tokens that are a functioning currency for numerous gambling sites, a new way to do transactions in gaming altogether” - says Stanislav Makarchuk, CTO of TruePlay.  The TruePlay Platform allows faster-than-ever transaction times between the player and the gambling project, ensuring quick, transparent payouts, with no waiting period. It’s a platform that enables a gambling project’s statistic to be accessible by all players, which serves as a guarantee that a gambling project has enough funds to cover all bets.

TruePlay — a Silver sponsor of the BlockchainUA event — presented a functional concept of integrating blockchain technology into online gambling.  “Ours is an approach to transparency, fairness, and user experience in online gambling that is dramatically different from anything the industry has seen before,” says Oleksii Ragozin, COO of TruePlay.  TruePlay was first developed in 2017 by Oleksiy Mageramov, Stanislav Makarchuk and Oleksii Ragozin, who sought to create a truly transparent platform that any gambling project would be able to implement.  With TruePlay, blockchain technology is integrated at every critical level of the online gambling process.      At the paygate, TruePlay’s blockchain-based transaction system allows for quick token deposits and withdrawals, without the headache of long withdrawal periods, surprise commissions and the overall uncertainty that tainted numerous gambling project’s transactional models,  At the game level, TruePlay publishes the game’s result to blockchain before the game begins, sealing the results in a tamper-proof manner, guaranteeing that a game’s results are formulated before the bets are placed on the table. Such a system creates a truly fair game environment, unaffected by the amount or quality of bets.  In terms of gambling affiliates and their relationship with the gambling operator, TruePlay is unique in that it allows for a transparent player ledger, enabling affiliates to see the number of players they brought to the project, their bets, and the commision that results from them. Before TruePlay, affiliates were entirely at the mercy of gambling operators, but with blockchain-based tech, that’s no longer the case.  TruePlay is issuing TruePlay (TPLAY) — a utility token that provides access to gambling platforms. TPLAY allows for an unprecedented level of transparency in gambling by eliminating the game’s susceptibility to manipulation from operators and ensuring the public’s trust. In 2019, TruePlay is planning to enable a blockchain gambling system that is going to have none of the limitations presented by the ETH blockchain.",False

Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? The difference? Core concepts of honesty and transparency.  Some might think this is another marketing concept or promotional strategy. Yet, at TruePlay, we believe these two simple words — honesty and transparency — describe and communicate our core values to all the industry stakeholders. Having had years of experience in the business, we now strive to eliminate mistrust between gamblers, operators, affiliates and game providers, and help them, once again — enjoy the game.  How do we do that? Here’s what TruePlay brings to the table for each member of the community:  1. Gamblers.  They want to play (obviously) and win! More accurately, they want to win more money than lose, although, sometimes, losses are good because they make the game more exciting. But it is more important for gamblers to be sure the game outcome is fair. Game results must not be connected with, for example, size of the bets or anything else. Only pure odds.  Unfortunately there are a lot of online casinos that continuously change the rules during the game without gamblers expecting anything. We’ve solved this problem. Gambling on TruePlay platform means that all gamblers are protected from fraud. No one can interfere and juggle the mechanics thanks to blockchain technology, which serves as the basis of the platform. The system always generates the sequence of game rounds before the game begins. Moreover, everyone gets complete access to the overall game stats directly from game provider.  One more thing we’ve taken care of is user-friendliness. We believe that gamblers want more than just fair play. They don’t want to worry about different limitations, difficulties with payoffs and so on. Nothing should distract or annoy gamblers . That’s where TruePlay comes in. We’ve made it so there is no need to register in different games separately, wait for payments and send a bunch of documents to approve every transaction. All gamblers need to do is to register on TruePlay and pass the KYC procedure (Know Your Customer). We’ve based the platform on a unified game currency — TPLAY — and guarantee all winning payouts instantly, regardless of the size. It also means gamblers can conduct instant transactions and payments with no limitations of amounts.  2. Operators.  Everything we mentioned before also positively affects companies that organise online gambling, casinos, bets, etc. Honesty and transparency is embedded in the TruePlay platform to ensure trust and loyalty of gamblers and makes gambling more attractive. Single game currency and our KYC procedure remove risks of financial fraud. No more issues with payments being stolen from credit cards. And both operators and gamblers will have a proof of payments and services that were provided.  We have even more surprises — and they’re huge!  Remember we have guaranteed gamblers instant payouts regardless of their size? Don’t worry, it doesn’t mean you need to hold huge amounts of money in reserve. We will create the reserve ourselves so that you’ll have money for marketing and loyalty programs, for example.  Also, you can forget about unstable traffic. Blockchain technology allows us to make content available at high speed, even where internet coverage is spotty. Plus, because TruePlay platform isn’t tied to a certain geolocation, together and there’s a big bunch of games from world game providers available — your audience will literally be worldwide — in every country where online gambling is legal.  By the way, TruePlay already cooperates with PokerDom and Gamingtec! The former already accepts TPLAY tokens and the latter launched the fully TruePlay based pilot project https://fairplay.io!  3. Game developers.  We know what development is and we know how vital it is for you to focus on the important things. As we mentioned, TruePlay solves problems with content availability and audience. But, there’s another issue. Bureaucracy and sluggishness of big companies can slow development, especially when it comes to integration of new games.  The TruePlay platform makes the integration of new games seamless and smooth. No additional technical work is needed.  We have already integrated games of Spinomenal into the TruePlay platform.  4. Affiliates.  Usually affiliates face a number of financial problems. Again everything is linked with honesty and transparency. Sometimes shifty operators can cover and manipulate gamblers’stats to delay, or even stop, payments for no reason. Affiliates don’t have access to all of the necessary game stats and can’t verify if those stats are true or not. They may think their gamblers simply stopped playing while operator gains all of the profit.  In the TruePlay this is technically impossible. All transactions between participants are tied since they registered in. It guarantees the access to overall correct statistics and instant payments of the reward.  Still have any questions how the platform works? Drop us a line at info@trueplay.io and we’ll be happy to tell you more.  P.S. Our token sale starts in May, so be sure to follow our social media for more updates!",False

An established and well-respected member of the gambling community, Oleksiy sees blockchain as a gamechanger for the industry that he’s long been part of.   “What we envisioned was a uniquely transparent platform that any gambling project would be able to implement. TruePlay offers a number of a unique solutions that have the potential to revolutionize gambling platforms and allow players to have a fair gaming experience that was previously unheard of in the industry,” says Stanislav Makarchuk — a 15 year veteran of the online gambling industry. Trueplay, where he serves as the CTO, is his first venture into blockchain technology.   Trueplay allows faster-than-ever transaction times between the player and the gambling project, ensuring quick, transparent payouts, with no expectation period.  Financial security is of the utmost importance for any gambling platform. Before TruePlay, gambling projects had no ability to guarantee payout, as their ledger would remain centralized and inaccessible to players. Sometimes, players would make bets, but a gambling project wouldn’t have enough funds to cover them in case of a win. The TruePlay platform enables a decentralized ledger that is accessible to all players, and therefore serves as a guarantee that a gambling project has enough funds to cover all bets.   For players, it was often difficult to make large deposits for high bets, and they had no possibility of a simple, easy withdrawal of funds. Trust was also an enormous issue in online gambling, as platforms would often implement algorithms that would deal out wins and losses based on the amount of money the player has bet, and thus rendering the game unfair.  TruePlay improves transaction time greatly, since it allows for lightning-fast token payments. It solves the problem of insufficient funds by providing a full statistic from across all operators, ensuring they have enough funds for a payout. Most importantly, it publishes the HASH of a game’s result to blockchain before the game commences, thus sealing the results in a tamper-proof manner. TruePlay guarantees that a game’s results are decentralized and formulated before the bets are placed, and in such it creates a guaranteed fair game, unaffected by the amount and quality of bets, an industry-first.    For affiliates, the operator would often be a “black box” — there would be no way to control affiliate rewards, leading to frustration and mistrust, and not to mention, pay delays. Trueplay takes care of that, its transparency is rooted in blockchain, and it has implemented smart contracts as means to guarantee reward payments.  TruePlay is issuing WinCoin (WNC), a utility token based that provides access to gambling platforms. WNC allows for an unprecedented level of transparency in gambling by eliminating the game’s susceptibility to manipulation from operators and ensuring the public’s trust.  The WinCoin token: PRE-SALE: April 15 — April 30 TOKEN SALE: TBA  Medium",False
