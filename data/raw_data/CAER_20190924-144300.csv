The Career Driver Compass is a 50 question survey developed by our Partners, Emergenetics International, with a psychometrically valid algorithm that rank orders 9 different work place motivators (see graphic below) to reveal what aspects of a job that each individual prefers.  Corporate recruiters match the ideal motivator set for their open positions, to the candidates that are available for the most ideal fit.  It is a strengths-based approach, and there is no right or wrong answer to the survey.  Emergenetics has used it for years, and it is a very accurate and valuable tool in the placing candidates who are most likely going to enjoy and succeed in their jobs.  A lot of times it is difficult to truly understand it until you try it.  Thus, for the next 24 hours, I will grant complimentary access to anyone who would like to experience the Career Driver Compass.  I will provide a one page summary of what the Career Driver Compass says about how you prefer to approach work, as well as a couple of paragraphs of interpretation.

These factors are all preference-based (e.g. Desire for Structure, Enjoys Problem Solving, Willingness to Change, etc.), so there is no right or wrong answer.  By knowing a person's motivators, you can ensure that you are matching their preferences with the aspect of the job.  For example, if you were hiring for a job where the task requires a person to sit at a desk all day and edit spreadsheets for content accuracy, you would want to hire a person that is motivated by a Need to be Perfect (one of the factors that we can measure).  If you wanted someone to be more of an outside sales person and meet with clients and prospects all day, you would almost certainly want this person to be motivated by Close Personal Relationships (Another factor we can measure).  We have been using the personal driver compass for several years, and it greatly improves the effectiveness of matching the right person for the needs of the job.",False
