As for me, I’m confused by the fact that, for example, I’ve set a goal to work but investments but I will have just to play and struggle to become a winner. They often use the “fun” word in the WP. Of course it’s funny, but are there any preliminary estimations of the amount of people who will use such a platform? Are there any surveys?  This is a very good question indeed. There were a few attempts to gamify finance (but none were as intuitive as ours), and therefore there is not alot of data to learn from. For these reasons we have tested the model in a group of 100 testes and the responses were reassuring, as people were very excited and close to 50% said they would have played regularly if the platform was already online. To finish answering your question - FundFantasy targets online traders, amateur and professional alike, as well as gamers and fantasy sports users who have a financial touch, or would like to develop it in a fun environment.",False

People should be able to go into voluntary interactions with each other, and should be able to choose what to do with their resources. No one should be able to tell anyone how to act - and people should protect their right to play.  Having said that, we do understand that speculation can lead to compulsive behaviour, which (especially if unprofitable) can wreak havoc in a man's life. For this reason we have adopted Responsible-Gaming policies - which allow users to limit their activity or completely self-exclude, whether temporarily or indefinitely.  Quote from: defender77 on January 05, 2018, 09:14:37 AM Greetings. What kind of problems and obstacles do developers see in the development of the project? Can anything hinder the development? In my opinion, the project balances on the thin line between real investment and gambling. [/quote]  Ask any experienced trader - every investment borders with gambling. The distinction is completely fictional. Both are speculative, stochastic, risky and done for a profit. That being said - unless the government completely shuts down the internet and the entire blockchain along with it, and unless they criminalize cryptocurrency, FundFantasy will be launched as expected.  It is possible however that certain jurisdictions will not allow us to operate within their borders, and we intend to comply with the relevant regulations in each jurisdictions.",False

FundFantasy will not feature poker and or any other game aside from our simulated investing contests.  With regards to the airdrop and your inflation related worries - Our contest's smart contract will continuously and automatically burn 0.5% of every FUNDZ prize-pool on the platform. FundToken is a deflationary currency and the deflation will increase as the our platform grows and becomes a success. The airdrop is designed in such a way as to prevent the dilution of FUNDZ purchasers in relation to the team or the total market cap. Each participant will get more tokens if there are any tokens left unsold, and even thought its true that the price per token will decrease - participants in the ICO will retain the value of their investment.  Mathemathically speaking, our method is provably superior to the burning strategy, and should become standard practice in the world of ICO's  We will expand on the superiority of the airdrop compared to burning and how does it relate to the FundFantasy project in the upcoming days.",False
