To achieve this, we’re building an advanced ecosystem that combines a machine learning AI, a clinic, a marketplace, and a community.  Underpinning all of these features is blockchain technology. Its use allows patient data to be decentralized and freely accessed at scale. It also incentivizes those involved to play an active role in our ecosystem: by rewarding them with our native ERC-223 tokens, OPU Coins.

We appreciate your attention to detail and have been working very hard to onboard dermatologists and medical professionals from all around the globe. Our core team has a ton of startup experience along with a very strong blockchain advisor board to help execute a successful crowdsale.  In response to your fundamental questions, Opu Labs aims to provide an affordable, tangible solution to skincare treatment that is currently very difficult to come by, especially in third world countries. Our application will provide step by step instructions on which areas of your skin need improvement along with offering clinical services and products that will directly be able to fix these issues. As you mentioned, our demo is currently available for anyone to try at https://opu.ai/  Verified dermatologists will be able to offer online consultations to allow our users to receive real-time support from experienced professionals for an affordable price (paid in OPU).  Additionally, our users are incentivized to participate in in-app research campaigns and to provide detailed product reviews to help formulate more organic reviews rather than the clouded reviews on traditional sites.  OPU Coin will act as the principal payment unit in the application and will initially be created through in-app usage by users and medical professionals. As our application grows, users will have the opportunity to purchase products and schedule appointments at a discount using OPU. Medical professionals will have the ability to purchase data recorded in our research studies and offer their OPU Coin to real users through structured campaigns facilitated by Opu Labs.  Please be on the lookout for v2 of our whitepaper which will directly highlight additional utility use cases along with providing further literature surrounding the Opu Marketplace and the on-boarding of Asian markets where we will first launch the app.    ",False
