In 2 months tokens which are left on this wallet will be send to U.S. Department of the Treasury. If they won’t accept tokens we’ll burn them or sell on the Exchanges or give as bonus to our investors.  By the way, listing on big Exchanges will take place only after the distribution is over. That means in 2 months we will finish with distribution and move on: list NLS token on big exchanges, launch Neluns Exchange and whole Neluns ecosystem. We won’t add NLS token to the Exchanges so bounty hunters won’t have chance to sell tokens while distribution isn’t over. But after distribution is done we’ll start to list NLS token on the Exchanges.",True
