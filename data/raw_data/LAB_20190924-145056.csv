But I'm wondering why the LabCoin token is being created, when it's only used for investing in projects and paying to project creators.  ETH can do that just as easily.  The whitepaper mentions a 2% fee on LabCoin transactions made on the platform.  Seems like that could be done with ETH as well.  Investors are paid in ETH, according to the whitepaper.  But that is actually a hindrance - they then have to convert that ETH back into LabCoin for investing into new projects?  That means transfer fees, exchange fees, exchange withdrawal fees, etc.  Why not just use ETH for everything?  Making a new ERC-20 token doesn't really insulate you against big fluctuations in the crypto market.  I'm not anti-ERC-20.  But when the ERC-20 doesn't seem to really do anything more than ETH can do - why make a new token?  Edit: By the way, the telegram channel isn't letting me post anything, or I'd have asked there first.  Is it an announcements only channel?",False

Also, thank you for your relevant questions.   LabCoins (LAB) is a utility token that gives us flexibility and control over the evolution of the project, as well as the ""currency"" used to invest the project presented on the platform.  I agree with you that for every ICO project, tokens could at the end of the day be replaced by ETH. Some other ICOs (like ours) issue tokens because it allows them to uncorrelate the price of the token from the ETH market. If in practice we are still in a speculation market which makes the price of tokens still linked to the ETH market, on the long term, the prices should be uncorrelated.  Even if correlated to the cryptocurrency market price firstly, in a second time and on longer-term, the LabCoin (LAB) price will mainly be correlated to the value of the innovation projects on the platform and will gradually uncorellate itself from the price of other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.  Moreover, from a technical point of view, issuing our own ERC20 token allow us to develop services and interfaces around it, and to make the interaction between our platform and other Ethereum blockchain based services more clear and convenient.   The transaction fee on the platform might change in the future. Its basically a maintenance fee that will allow our team to maintain the platform and to upgrade it.  As for the payement, our goal is that the investors could choose in which currency they would like to be paid. For now we only support ETH and LAB payement but we will add more currencies in the near future.   Regards",False

The advantages of our platform is that it offers companies and project teams in needs of funding for an innovation project a new way to fund their project. Hence, in a lot of cases, companies struggle to obtain money from banks. Recently, kickstarters have been a funding alternative trying to give a solution to this issue. However, kickstarters do not allow to directly invest in a project. More recently, other alternatives such as The DAO (rip) or Aragon have proposed to use blockchain to directly invest in new companies, allowing investors to detain shares of the company. However, no proper solution yet exist to invest in a specific project of a company. The LabStart platform will allow that (for innovative projects). Investors will be able to invest in innovation projects via the LabStart platform. At the end of the innovation project, every investor will own shares of the resulting patents.  To sum up, from a company point of view, LabStart is a new way to fund an innovation project. It allows companies to raise funds for a R&D project, without selling any company shares. From an investor point of view, LabStart is a way to invest in innovation project and to own shares of the resulting patents, allowing ROI through licences and patent sales.  For more info, I advise you to read this article. Please also read our whitepaper to fully understand the LabStart project.  Regards",False

I will try to answer briefly to your question:  1. Currently, it is hard for people to have access to investment in innovation. On the one hand, one can indirectly invest through investment centers while having the role of a business angel. This option is available only if one has contacts and a lot of money to invest.  On the other hand, one can simply deposit money in the banks. They will invest your money in stock markets or various sectors, including innovation, getting high ROI while giving one’s little interest for using your money. -> During this investment process, many intermediaries take advantage of the invested money as well, like investment companies or incubators.  2. We propose a new model for investment in innovation, cutting intermediaries. People directly invest in the innovation projects featured on the LabStart Platform. Once the innovation process finished and the technology or the product itself developed, each investor will hold one share of the patent ownership. Sharing the patent ownership and tracking the innovative process are made thanks to the blockchain and smart contracts technology, and the principles of the Decentralized Organisations.  3. Using patent rights as a reward for the investors, will allow them to both detain property rights on the innovation, and to make profits via the patent licenses exploitation fees and the patent sales.",False

Some major society challenges such as ecology, overcrowding, or else decentralization appeal to the capacity of our societies to find innovative solutions that will help solve these issues. Yet it is currently very hard for an individual to get directly involved in an innovative project. Considering the importance of the innovative impact on our life now and in the future, we think that anyone must have the opportunity to get involved in this process, and at every level of responsibilities.   https://s17.postimg.cc/ch81h0p9b/video.jpg    A new way to fund innovation   In order to open the innovative ecosystem to everyone, LabStart intends to use the various models of crowdfunding by incorporating the concept of patents. Once the project of innovating finished and the technology or the product itself developed, each investor will hold one share of the patent ownership. Sharing the patent ownership and tracking the innovative process are made thanks to the blockchain and smart contracts technology, via the LabStart platform.   Introducing LabStart platform   LabStart platform is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum network providing a link between innovative project bearers and investors. Thus anyone can support the innovative projects present on the platform. Once the innovation developed, one or several patents are filed, in order to protect the invention. Each investor owns then shares of the filed patents, in proportion to their initial investment.  https://s17.postimg.cc/gevb6au1b/How_it_works.jpg    Roadmap  https://s17.postimg.cc/vov6df4y7/roadmap.jpg    LabStart Team & Advisors   Information about our team members & advisors is available on our Team page.    LabCoin Token Sale  LabCoins (LAB) are ERC20 tokens created on the Ethereum network. LabCoin is the currency that allows investors to fund the innovation projects featured on the LabStart platform. For every investor the amount of LabCoins invested in a project coincide with the patent shares owned at the end of the project (see the Whitepaper for more details).  https://s17.postimg.cc/9cxdjxy3j/Lab_Coin_fondgris.jpg   PRE-SALE 1 ETH = 500 LAB Hard Cap = 8,400,000 LAB  ICO Token Price (first 15 days): 1 ETH = 400 LAB Token Price (last 15 days): 1 ETH = 300 LAB Hard Cap = 22,200,000 LAB Soft Cap = 1000 ETH  No more LabCoins will be created after the ICO.    https://s17.postimg.cc/5tbfuavfj/Useoffunds_tokendistribution.png    Bounty Program  We’ll reserve 5% of the total LAB supply for the bounty campaigns, which will be distributed at the end of the ICO.
