First of all, we apologize for the silence of the last couple of days. We are sure that some of the news we are about to share will compensate for the absence of recent announcements 🙂  So what has been happening with the project?  First of all, second ICO round has been completed. Although it finished below the soft cap, still it raised capital equivalent to $240,000. We decided not to stop the ICO here, but rather continue with the third round that will launch in the coming days. This decision is dictated by the fact that despite the second round results shortage, we will again demonstrate real progress in the project.   Secondly, we are happy to talk about the current and future successes of The Memessenger: - Completed final rebranding of the application, including a new redesign - Updated and expanded content database. More than 100 audio-visual stickers created from scratch - iPhone version of The Memesseger is designed and available for downloading - Android version of The Memessenger is developed and published - Additional Russian-language stickers developed and will soon be added - More than 50 new English-language memes have been developed and will be added soon - Number of software implementations improvements was made - In the near future a new product concept with the integration of MET into the internal mechanics of the application will be announced - The ability to transfer tokens onto an internal decentralized exchange will be added. (more details later)  Thirdly, recently we managed to participate in a number of important events in the crypto community: - delivered a lecture on provocative marketing using the example of The Memessenger as part of the IIDF-organized event called St.Petersburg StartUp Day in St. Petersburg, Russia - took part in CryptoBazaar event in Moscow, Russia - our team acted as the organizer of a series of meetings for our now friend Miko Matsumura - a very well-regarded expert in the crypto world: in particular, a meeting with Sasha Ivanov from the Waves Platform, as well as with top management of the IIDF.  Finally, we have become a more global, infrastructure project in the field of crypto currency. We will make a detailed announcement within two or three weeks, but we guarantee you that this will not leave you indifferent!  The Memessenger continues its development. As stated above, the target of the new round will be announced in the next couple of days. Follow the news and app updates!   With faith in mutual success, The Memessenger Team",False

During the first month it is planned to invite $150 000 (quite a little by the current cryptocurrency market standards), and the sum is totally reasonable.  Unlike other projects, we are not going to raise let’s say $8 MIO within the ICO with an unclear project and investments future. Our goal is to raise investments softly, step by step. You can find more detailed description of its mechanics in our White Paper. In brief: - over the first round of the ICO it is planned to raise $150 000; - over the second round (before which, btw, we are demonstrating statistics and an activity report) it is planned to raise $800 000; - over the third round - according to our preliminary forecasts, it is planned to invite $5 000 000. BUT! This amount will be real if we really make headway on the project itself.  This logic will be followed during all 10 rounds of the ICO. The scenario is comprised of 10 rounds of the ICO, each of which includes limited issue of tokens; before each round we are opening statistics on the current success of the project based on key metrics. And it is a core principle for us to have a strategy based on transparency, clarity and a true possibility of seeing what is happening with the project in real time.",False

The project team declares serious progress in the development of the messenger itself: in the nearest month the rebranding will be finalized and an international promotional campaign launched.

Telegram offers good memes we also use. But the Memessenger has a different kind of mechanics. The mechanics of the app, when a sound of a sticker plays automatically on a user’s phone (assuming the phone is not in a silent mode), opens up fresh opportunities of use. You can pull your friends' legs, create comic situations, and just emotionally relax in the middle of a working day. It is only a small bunch of reasons for a positive feedback from the audience of the project. The current set of audio-visual stickers in the app represents both ""classic"" and ""trend"" memes. Our content team adds new stickers in a quick and easy way which ensures permanent relevance of the messenger. Moreover, we believe that, in case of a worldwide success, the Memessenger (ex DITCH) will get to be kind of a memes and entertainment content feed. With this background, the values of the Memessenger and Telegram absolutely differ from each other despite both are messengers.",False

The exchange rate of a MET per round of ICO will depend on the real project success (based on clear metrics). We are going to offer online access to analytics and comprehensible reports on all the key app’s metrics for a market-based valuation to conform with real success indexes and development dynamics. At the end of the 5th round - the equator of the project - it is planned to output MET token on the exchange. There is a possibility of a speculative trade prior to the release of MET token on the exchange, however, for this actions we have implemented HOLD option, which runs +1 round from the moment the token is exchanged. Thus, if an ICO participant exchanges a token within the 1st ICO round, it will not be possible for him to exchange the token before the 2nd round of the ICO is completed and all the tokens reserved for the round are realized.

At the moment the issue is being worked out. There are also bonuses at a pre-ICO stage provided for early-birds: Practically, the first round constitutes as the pre-ICO. The duration of the round will be 1 month at the most, or will continue to the moment of a complete 1 000 000 MET token exchange. 1 day: the exchange rate - $0,20 - MAX amount for the exchange - 500 000 MET 2-7 day: the exchange rate - $0,50, MAX amount for the exchange - 500 000 MET 2 week: the exchange rate - $0,70 3 week: the exchange rate - $0,80 4 week: the exchange rate - $1 The first round of ICO ends either after the expiration of a month from the starting date or after an exchange of all 1 000 000 MET tokens. Within the round the minimum resources are being collected to begin the full-scale ICO project. The round can be considered as successful in the event of an exchange of tokens to other ones equivalent to $150,000, otherwise all tokens will be returned to participants after deduction of commissions for the reverse transfer. At the stage of the 1st and the 2nd rounds the price for MET tokens is assigned by the developers. MET exchange rate during rounds 3 - 10 of the ICO will be determined on the basis of the company's capital ratios and internal metrics of project. The project team includes the following metrics in a number of important for an objective market evaluation of the project and transparency of prospects: - DAU / WAU / MAU - Retention - Virality - Net Promoter Score (NPS) - Loyalty index - LTV (Life Time Value) - CMGR (Compounded Monthly Growth Rate) - Churn - Outflow of customers Thus, the complex project growth index will be based on the multivariate analysis, and will contribute to the elimination of possible speculative risks. Internal project metrics are intended for a public presentation. One of the goals of the ICO of The Memessenger is to provide participants with the opportunity to monitor growth, practically, online. This approach is the know-how of the ICO project, which will allow to predict the scenario of the project development. Participants will be able to see any development strategy has been chosen by the project team, how effective it is as a team to cope with the tasks - and more. The project team obviously guarantees the targeted use of the resources involved within the ICO, and ICO participants will be able to real-time assess how effectively the resources are being used by the team and what new prospects are opening up for the project (or not being opened). At the end of the 5th round - the equator of the project - it is planned to output the MET token on the exchange. Prior to the release of the MET token on the exchange, speculative trade in the token is possible, however, HOLD for these actions will last a +1 round from the moment the token is exchanged. Thus, if an ICO participant exchanged a token for the 1st round of the ICO, then it will not be possible to exchange it before the second round of the ICO is completed and the full implementation of the tokens reserved for this round. Thus, the interests of members are maximally protected from speculative attacks, and forecasting the development of the project is possible to implement with a much higher degree of accuracy. In the ICO section of The Memessenger website an ICO participant calculator will be implemented to simulate the period of possession of the token based on the current project metrics and the growth forecast for the 3 stages (ICO round) forward. Such a service improvement will strengthen the key differences between the ICO project and similar projects.",False
