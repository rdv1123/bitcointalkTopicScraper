We analyze a driver pre-& post-accident behavior, set our trust index on the basis of a driver’s insurance and claims history record, etc. This enables us to detect high fraud risk incidents and to cut the insurers’ leakage and decrease the fraud rate. This innovation is presented in details below (see Development Plan, 2.4). Its impact on the profitability of kasko2go (Liechtenstein) AG, and therefore on its competitive advantage is expected to be material. Today, 7 out of 10 motor insurance claims have some fraudulent behaviour (increased damages, combination of few damages into one, multiple use of same crashed parts in staged accidents, cash-for-crash and paper collisions). The frequency of these issues is materially negatively affecting the profitability of insurance companies. Unable to investigate each minor claim, insurance carriers are losing up to 40B USD annually in the US only (according to the FBI only investigated cases). The system will allow 98% accuracy in fraud detection, drastically reducing the loss rates.",False

The program uses incentive mechanisms to induce the customers to improve their driving. The pilot projects have shown that a client’s desire to get maximum insurance discount and not to score worse than the rest bring about improvement in his/her driving skills and fosters road safety culture within kasko2go’s community. That in its turn lowers the accident rate and considerably reduces the insurer’s risks. ● Reinsurance cost. Verified risk rate reduction will lead to proportional decrease of compulsory state reserve volumes and cut down the reinsurance costs. In the course of our current negotiations with the large reinsurers they confirm their willingness to review the cost of their services in case they get additional information about the customers.,False

The program uses incentive mechanisms to induce the customers to improve their driving. The pilot projects have shown that a client’s desire to get maximum insurance discount and not to score worse than the rest bring about improvement in his/her driving skills and fosters road safety culture within kasko2go’s community. That in its turn lowers the accident rate and considerably reduces the insurer’s risks. ● Reinsurance cost. Verified risk rate reduction will lead to proportional decrease of compulsory state reserve volumes and cut down the reinsurance costs. In the course of our current negotiations with the large reinsurers they confirm their willingness to review the cost of their services in case they get additional information about the customers.,False
