Our roadmap is definitely clear. Our team members are previous founders and highly experienced developers, which isn't reflected in the score. Token demand will increase dramatically as our product scales and when it comes to fulfillment of storing your data; we even take your data offline so it's better protected against any form of intrusion, something certainly not reflected in the score. I find it odd they rate negatively for not publishing your financial forecasts, as it's not standard process in the ICO environment and any company would be hesitant to do that. Of course the files are there.  Definitely agree the project needs more buzz, which is something we're working on.",False

The Second Job for EVERYONE!,"   Hi ottogary,  We absolutely agree that a great strategy is key. It is not possible for a startup to do marketing to the entire world at once. It's important to focus on a small geographical region and then to create a network effect there. Also, the product itself should be perfect; super user-friendly, not intimidating, something you'd show to your grandmother. We're doing all of those things. Most of us are previous or current company founders    To us, how to bring it to market is even more important than how to make it.  (+ we have some wicked, but undisclosed connections in the first market that will help fill the App with tons of reputable people who will give the App immediate credibility).  Besides, there really aren't too many similar concept, I feel. The world is massive. When Anything App has mass adoption in just one country (which is achievable on the short term), we we will have 100,000's of people using our crypto on a daily basis. When we go for critical mass in the second country, we're looking at millions. You don't need the whole world, you just a need a country or two to moon beyond belief.",False

The Second Job for EVERYONE!,"   Hi moirahpascual11!  On our Reddit, we've got this post. It has a list of things we expect people to talk about. This list has been typed up in just a few minutes, so it's not perfect by any means, but it'll give you an idea.  For both of these sides, you could be either buying the information, or providing it as a seller. Naturally, not all groups will have massive traffic on the App immediately, but we're able to see what's working in which cities and market those effectively. Aside from what is more prominently marketed, all other verticals will still be available. And we'll be educating our users which verticals still need sellers too!  Anything App is the platform which people will use to help each other over the phone. It's that simple.

You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't have a need for this service from time to time and it doesn't exist yet.  There are so many people who have a profession, but are more passionate and knowledgeable about something else. Finally they will have a chance to monetize that. They will help others and earn extra income themselves. If they are living a life of counting pennies in the supermarket, then Anything App will be an amazing resource to them.  As you can tell, the team here is kinda passionate  . And we're on the second prototype.    This one's for you. Since we're going to launch about half a year from now, imagine this: whenever you're going to buy a car >6months from now, don't forget to video a hobbyist who knows second hand cars. You can show him the car and he'll tell you what's up. Just type it in our search bar. This is going to be a reality sooner than you think! (Unless you're thinking 6 months, in which case you'd be correct.)",False

Reviews - in their profile you can see his or her rating and read text reviews posted by others. 2. Ask the seller a question - before you contact them you can text them in-app to pre-qualify them as someone who can provide the knowledge you need. 3. Guarantee badge - sellers can apply for a badge in to be posted in their profile. If they can't help you, they won't accept payment from you after the call. 4. Post call - if the seller can't help you, in the post-call flow, they can choose to not accept payment. You receive a notification as soon as they choose to accept or not accept payment. You take that into account before leaving a rating/review. Sellers are motivated to protect their rating.",False

The Second Job for EVERYONE!,"   Hi Dixon, great question.  Fortunately, it's not just 1 differentiating factor:  - Crucially, our App doesn't limit itself to text. It has the option to video-call, call or chat; all inside the App. Especially video-call is massive, as currently the internet doesn't have eyes yet. Also, it's hard to transfer emotion through text. With the option to video, you can look at issues together with someone knowledgeable, which opens up tons of options which simply didn't exist. Want to buy a second hand car? Show the car to a hobbyist and ask him what to pay attention to. Terrible sense of style? Video-chat a fashion-student and ask them whether or not to buy those pants or what's important when purchasing a suit. Need to repair or build something? Show the project with video to someone who can tell you what to turn and twist.  - Our buyers can contact sellers immediately. That means you don't have to wait. Traditional forums and Earn.com are fantastic resources, but they are based around waiting for the seller's convenience to respond. Anything App gives power to both buyer and seller. Sellers set their availability schedules, and in turn the buyers know that they can always contact the people popping up in the search straight away.  - Mass adoption. Everyone has valuable knowledge. Everyone. More often than not, they don't even share it. Could be a hobby; Anything (pun?). But we are all quite proud of what we do well. Most of us enjoy helping others. Our approach to marketing (amongst others) is to make everyone feel the emotional satisfaction of helping others. No matter if they get a call once per month or 5 per day. Our App is super user friendly and we're stepping away from an elitist approach. It's people helping each other. Naturally, you'll see inside the App which seller gives you best value for money, so don't worry about that aspect too.  - Search engine. Our search engine learns over time to ensure you're getting the right results as soon as possible.  - Community (society) building. This is my personal favorite. Once we have more and more users, which we will, we have developed strategies to ensure that the calls don't go to a couple of super-sellers inside Anything App. Rather, we're going to be connecting people to each other. After all, if you need a knowledgeable mechanic, it's fantastic if you're developing a relationship with the one close to you, rather than on the other side of the country. That way, he's getting some calls too and when you have to bring in a car sometime, you can catch up.  That's it for now. What do you think about it?",False
