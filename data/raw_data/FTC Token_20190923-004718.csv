Quote from: TimeTeller on November 01, 2017, 07:39:23 AM Quote from: Conqueror on November 01, 2017, 07:26:00 AM Usually, when you create name and ticker for a coin, you look at coinmarketcap and use CRTL+F. It seems this process was way too challenging for this ""devs""  FTC=Feathercoin  Though this one is an eth token, they still have to change their ticker. Feathercoin has been here for so long already so even if they are of different in nature, I believe it's not right to use their ticker. Anyway, good luck to the team if they can really get good community out of this.  Thank you all for the support!
