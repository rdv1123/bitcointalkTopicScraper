I am sure there are many out there who needs our help and at times one stops us is the fact that people who collect money to help such charitable institutions often do not do what they say. The money thus collected is often gone to the individual pockets and the actual institution receives nothing or a very less portion of the collected money. With blockchain helping such organization will bring in transparency and authenticity for sure.  Good Luck!!,False

As you may have noticed, we have budgeted PR specialist salaries, who will create and maintain a favorable public image in USA and European countries through television, newspapers/magazines (e.g. Forbes, Huffington Post, RBC and etc.) till May 2018.  We have also provided for SMM specialist services to promote and increase awareness within popular social media platforms (e.g. facebook, twitter, vkontakte and etc.). Hence, we believe such funds allocation to be optimal in targeting wide coverage.",False
