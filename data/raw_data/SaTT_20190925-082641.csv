Thanks to you, we are constantly improving. In my opinion, the greatest success factor of a project is the support of an active community and taking into consideration its opinion, values that we have honoured since the beginning of ATAYEN, and that we apply to the SaTT project.  Therefore we updated the SaTT project as well as the Whitepaper in order to answer both the community’s comments and those of the experts in the sector. Indeed, we received a lot of feedback after the launch of our project. We were able to meet experts such as Crypto-Analysis, Chaineum, ICOBox, Cryptopotatoe, Miguel RT, TheRightICO, Cointelegraph, Amazix... who gave us precious advice.   Technical wallet update:   - Improvement of the website: www.satt-token.com  - Registration without Facebook, addition of Google Connect and registration and Login SaTT  - Added airdrop 25 SaTT for completion KYC  - Addition of 5% + 5% affiliate affiliation  - Improvement of the general ergonomics of the wallet  - Adding a transaction history  - Update of contact management  - Free ETH offer to initiate transactions  To test the new version of the Wallet, click HERE  Whitepaper update:   - Date of the end of the ICO changed to September 30th  - Hardcap changed to $ 49.5M  - Choice to burn undistributed tokens instead of re-allocating them to the reserve  - Establishment of a vesting plan for the partners and the team to block these tokens for a period of 1 year then a progressive release for 10 months to avoid a brutal dump on the market  - Adding renowned advisors  Download the updated Whitepaper, click HERE  Purchase guarantee  These last few weeks have been harsh on cryptocurrencies with significant drops that are slowing down investments. In order to guarantee your SaTT purchase at the best price, we set up a sure solution : if you buy today and the course of Ether or Bitcoin is higher during the last step of the ICO, we will pay you the difference in SaTT at the beginning of this step.  Extension of the Bounty  We have decided to extend our Bounty till the end of the ICO in September. If you want to check the new rules and the modifications, click HERE   We want to thank all participants, the experts who allow us to improve ourselves, and we assure you of the complete devotion of the team aiming towards SaTT’s success!
