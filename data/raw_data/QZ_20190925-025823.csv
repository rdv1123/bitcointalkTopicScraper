This ITO is going to be different. We don't use Ethereum, we use Waves. And we reward The Github Devs. As you know, Microsoft officially announced the deal: it is buying GitHub for $7.5 billion in an all-stock deal. At 28 Millions Developers worldwide, this deal equals to $267.85 per dev. Your data, your repositories, your time. So this is why we believe you deserve this. The IGT ITO transparently offers investors no value, so there will be no expectation of gains. No gains means few investors, few investors means few transactions, and few transactions means no Waves network lag. Oh, one more thing: the fee for Waves transaction is really low:0.001 Waves (~$0.00355, less than a cent/transaction).  More on igtokens.org   THE WORLD'S • FIRST 100% HONEST WAVES ITO",False

Yes we focus only on bloggers. Bloggers focus gives us an opportunity to make the best bloggers platform.  Blogger is a specialist. Platform doesn't matter. It could be text, audio or video content-platform. But not all social nets allow p2p advertising. Social networks are not interested in developing p2p advertising market as advertiser’s money goes directly to bloggers leaving out the social nets. Some Social networks have an opportunity to fight p2p market, but others can’t do anything. All social networks can be divided into two segments – communication oriented (Facebook, Instagram,...) and content oriented (YouTube, Twitch, Youku…). Communication oriented networks are mostly used for communication among friends. Such social networks camouflage advertising in posts and are not interested in supporting blogger’s activity which leads to an obvious limitation for bloggers and advertising with them. For instance, Facebook does not allow having more than 5000 friends. Instagram bans links to external sources. Content oriented networks are normally used for unique content. The main instrument for accessing the content is subscription to particular bloggers but this way requires following the social network’s instructions. Special competences and resources are necessary to generate high quality content. Being a part of such networks becomes a regular job for popular creators (bloggers). Normally, there is a high volume of content and the user needs time to check every post, so the network integrates advertising into this content. Such social networks cannot exist without bloggers. Therefore they are interested in opinion leaders’ development. It is useless for content oriented (Youtube, Twitch and so on) networks to fight p2p advertising. Any kind of pressure exerted on bloggers harms the audience. In such situation, content oriented networks can’t do anything to decrease p2p advertising market. So Youtube as the biggest content-oriented social network is our priority. Instagram, Facebook and others are not.",False

Platform doesn't matter. It could be text, audio or video content-platform. But not all social nets allow p2p advertising. Social networks are not interested in developing p2p advertising market as advertiser’s money goes directly to bloggers leaving out the social nets. Some Social networks have an opportunity to fight p2p market, but others can’t do anything. All social networks can be divided into two segments – communication oriented (Facebook, Instagram,...) and content oriented (YouTube, Twitch, Youku…). Communication oriented networks are mostly used for communication among friends. Such social networks camouflage advertising in posts and are not interested in supporting blogger’s activity which leads to an obvious limitation for bloggers and advertising with them. For instance, Facebook does not allow having more than 5000 friends. Instagram bans links to external sources. Content oriented networks are normally used for unique content. The main instrument for accessing the content is subscription to particular bloggers but this way requires following the social network’s instructions. Special competences and resources are necessary to generate high quality content. Being a part of such networks becomes a regular job for popular creators (bloggers). Normally, there is a high volume of content and the user needs time to check every post, so the network integrates advertising into this content. Such social networks cannot exist without bloggers. Therefore they are interested in opinion leaders’ development. It is useless for content oriented (Youtube, Twitch and so on) networks to fight p2p advertising. Any kind of pressure exerted on bloggers harms the audience. In such situation, content oriented networks can’t do anything to decrease p2p advertising market. So Youtube as the biggest content-oriented social network is our priority. Instagram, Facebook and others are not.",False

Native ad is a future of advertising.   Text, Video, Audio - it doesn't matter. The platform is important. All social networks can be divided into two segments – communication oriented (Facebook, Instagram,...) and content oriented (YouTube, Twitch, …). Communication oriented networks are mostly used for communication among friends. Such social networks camouflage advertising in posts and are not interested in supporting blogger’s activity which leads to an obvious limitation for bloggers and advertising with them. For instance, Facebook does not allow having more than 5000 friends. Instagram bans links to external sources.  Content oriented networks are normally used for unique content. The main instrument for accessing the content is subscription to particular bloggers but this way requires following the social network’s instructions. Special competences and resources are necessary to generate high quality content. Being a part of such networks becomes a regular job for popular creators (bloggers). Normally, there is a high volume of content and the user needs time to check every post, so the network integrates advertising into this content. Such social networks cannot exist without bloggers. Therefore they are interested in opinion leaders’ development. It is useless for content oriented (Youtube, Twitch and so on) networks to fight p2p advertising. Any kind of pressure exerted on bloggers harms the audience. In such situation, content oriented networks can’t do anything to decrease p2p advertising market. So Youtube as the biggest content-oriented social network is our priority. Instagram, Facebook and others are not",False

Why are we developing Efir.io? New native advertisement market paradigm That was because there were no free search engines which provided bloggers’ price rates and contact details on the market. But the absence of search engines wasn’t the only problem that we had faced. The fact that bloggers aren’t professional advertisers hampers getting high quality native advertisement. Moreover, it’s impossible to pay bloggers according to the classic CPA model. That’s because that kind of advertisement is more about PR than actual sales. Advertising agencies don’t really help the market. First of all, there are not that many of them. Secondly, the existing ones are drowning in work. Moreover, generally, the market is opaque.

And this applies to all the services. For example, bloggers can collaborate with media specialists from other countries, increase the quality of advertisement and satisfy advertisers who will come back to them over and over again. Besides, Blockchain helps to make the market more transparent as the external oracles monitor the deal and the recipient will get the payment only after all the conditions have been fulfilled. Efir can help advertisers avoid mistakes in working with bloggers and this will help native advertising market to develop further.

We launched efir.io in January of 2017 on a temporary domain qaazqaaz.com. During next 6 months every 4th top Russian speaking blogger joined efir.io. We invited bloggers by email. Business model and idea was so innovate and necessary for the market, so to reach 1/4 part of the CIS market we hadn't pay for advertising. In august 2017 we started foreign localization. By the end of march 2018 we have published intellectual search for 170 thousand youtube accounts from  all over the world.

But not everyone will be a professional. We will help bloggers to become professional. What competencies should a blogger have to become a professional? Blogger has to be a cameraman, sound director, video editor, screenwriter, graphic designer and so on at the same time. We know 8 main and 40 secondary competencies of the professional blogger.  We gather media market specialists to professional associations and make the blogger go through this associations. First stage is bloggers assessment. As a result we get a professional team consisting of a blogger and a market media specialists. Specialists could teach the blogger or get employed as a part of the team. When the blogger’s team is formed, venture investor could buy the blogger’s rights for future advertisement placements. Third stage - bloggers development. Collected funds are used by blogger’s team to develop. It leads to rising of the content quality, audience growths and increase in blogger’s advertising cost. So the advertising rights held by investor become more expensive. The last stage - to sell advertising rights using efir.io.

It gives an advertiser an opportunity to easily find and directly connect with bloggers.

Native ad is a future of advertising.   Text, Video, Audio - it doesn't matter. The platform is important. All social networks can be divided into two segments – communication oriented (Facebook, Instagram,...) and content oriented (YouTube, Twitch, …). Communication oriented networks are mostly used for communication among friends. Such social networks camouflage advertising in posts and are not interested in supporting blogger’s activity which leads to an obvious limitation for bloggers and advertising with them. For instance, Facebook does not allow having more than 5000 friends. Instagram bans links to external sources.  Content oriented networks are normally used for unique content. The main instrument for accessing the content is subscription to particular bloggers but this way requires following the social network’s instructions. Special competences and resources are necessary to generate high quality content. Being a part of such networks becomes a regular job for popular creators (bloggers). Normally, there is a high volume of content and the user needs time to check every post, so the network integrates advertising into this content. Such social networks cannot exist without bloggers. Therefore they are interested in opinion leaders’ development. It is useless for content oriented (Youtube, Twitch and so on) networks to fight p2p advertising. Any kind of pressure exerted on bloggers harms the audience. In such situation, content oriented networks can’t do anything to decrease p2p advertising market. So Youtube as the biggest content-oriented social network is our priority. Instagram, Facebook and others are not",False

We are planning to automate the hole business process of agency from the LOP to the final reports. It’s paid service. So every agency using it should increase the token value.   The third project at our marketplace is analytics. We monitor trends all over the world and we could quickly answer a lot of complex questions. For example, we could compare competing brands by their popularity in different regions. What is more popular Coke or Pepsi, BMW or Mercedes, Apple or Samsung?   The fourth project is PR quality assessment. We measure the emotional influence of bloggers advertising video to measure the PR outcome.

Yes we focus only on bloggers. Bloggers focus gives us an opportunity to make the best bloggers platform.  Blogger is a specialist. Platform doesn't matter. It could be text, audio or video content-platform. But not all social nets allow p2p advertising. Social networks are not interested in developing p2p advertising market as advertiser’s money goes directly to bloggers leaving out the social nets. Some Social networks have an opportunity to fight p2p market, but others can’t do anything. All social networks can be divided into two segments – communication oriented (Facebook, Instagram,...) and content oriented (YouTube, Twitch, Youku…). Communication oriented networks are mostly used for communication among friends. Such social networks camouflage advertising in posts and are not interested in supporting blogger’s activity which leads to an obvious limitation for bloggers and advertising with them. For instance, Facebook does not allow having more than 5000 friends. Instagram bans links to external sources. Content oriented networks are normally used for unique content. The main instrument for accessing the content is subscription to particular bloggers but this way requires following the social network’s instructions. Special competences and resources are necessary to generate high quality content. Being a part of such networks becomes a regular job for popular creators (bloggers). Normally, there is a high volume of content and the user needs time to check every post, so the network integrates advertising into this content. Such social networks cannot exist without bloggers. Therefore they are interested in opinion leaders’ development. It is useless for content oriented (Youtube, Twitch and so on) networks to fight p2p advertising. Any kind of pressure exerted on bloggers harms the audience. In such situation, content oriented networks can’t do anything to decrease p2p advertising market. So Youtube as the biggest content-oriented social network is our priority. Instagram, Facebook and others are not.",False
