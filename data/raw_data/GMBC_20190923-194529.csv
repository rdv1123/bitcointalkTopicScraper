Looks like it’s time for a quick update on the state of development and a general direction of Gamblica. First of all – we are great, thanks. March was good for us. Lots of interesting new ideas flowing, a couple of new developers joined our team, we found new international contacts, all of them potentially useful in accomplishing different tasks in our ultimate goal – one-stop gambling platform that treats players fairly and with respect. Our user base is growing steadily every day, and we’re starting to get some real traction in the gambling world.  We are also talking to several tier-one exchanges (no names yet). There’s a lot of moving parts in that one and many things to consider, but one can be pretty sure that there’ll be more news on that topic in the near future.  Now for the main course. Today we are teasing our new upcoming game. I honestly don’t know if this could be called “slot machine”, but whatever. Here comes new and exciting Super City. Super City is the next chapter of video slot game design evolution. A two-dimensional array of elements becomes a beautiful vibrant three-dimensional neighborhood. Combine different elements to build houses, get bonuses for residents, take risks while maximizing your profits at an auction. Now, there are many bonuses and ways to win big in this game, but the auction is really what elevates the game to the new level of fun. This auction thing is a cool mechanic that allows you to control the risk/reward ratio of the game. If you choose to ramp up the price for the house you get a chance to win more money while risking getting no deal at all. We have no ETA on the release, more news on that coming soon.  We are also currently in the process of revamping Purple Fox mechanics. The crafty little beast will get nine new bonuses, combining in different ways to generate multiple unique bonus games. It’s going to be super fun.  Here’s a quick little teaser: https://youtu.be/3GOrsbXuk2I  As usual – we are happy to answer all your questions or just chit chat in our telegram and other social media.  Love, Gamblica. ",False

It allows users to verify all transactions and review the RND algorithm of any bet or game. The global gambling market is currently experiencing rapid growth (CAGR 9% which is 3 times faster than the global GDP). Gamblica covers every gambling activity, including online casino games, sports betting, and poker. Implementation of blockchain technology into the online gambling industry will allow for building an absolutely transparent system. The outcome of each individual bet, spin, or the next played card is random and is determined by using a multi-factor model of random number generation, where the final value is determined on the basis of several input parameters. The GMBC token is an internal currency of the Gamblica platform, which is used for betting in all Gamblica games and sports betting. Besides, the platform's additional premium services can be purchased with GMBC tokens only. The token is deeply integrated into the system to ensure the maximum turnover, since the value of any cryptocurrency increases exponentially with the number of agents using it. The economy of the token is based on the imputed commission of various games, a bookmaker commission for accepting bets on various outcomes of a sports event, or a poker ""buying in"" fee. The business model of a casino is based on the fact that a player's probability of winning is lower than that of a casino (in red and black betting, there are 18 winning pockets for players against 19 for a casino; slot machines have a return-to-player value of 95%, 5% goes to a casino). That is why, in a long-term perspective, Gamblica makes profit.  Team LinkedIn profile of Gamblica consists of 16 young persons.

Law risks Several countries have monopoly on gambling, several ones restrict even popularization and advertising them in any form. It should be taken into consideration because it’s the main law risk and barrier for scaling and legal expansion of Gamblica worldwide.  Summary Gamblica is an interesting project and a bold attempt to create a fair gambling platform working without humans. This platform is free from traditional problems such as fraudulent behavior of some operators, account blocking, poor personal data protection. Blockchain, smart contracts, strong mathematics and cryptographic algorithms provide required quality level, trust and transparency. According to the Roadmap, the launch of the first part of the platform (casino) is planned for September 2018. Other modules (a poker room and betting platform) will be launched in June and December 2019 correspondingly. Unfortunately, there is no beta or prototype yet, therefore this fact has decreased the aggregated rating value.
