The idea is to ensure a stable payments channel along the first blockchain and record the intermediate application transaction in separate blockchains for each individual app.  For instance, using the second blockchain a user can find an app which solves his/her tasks. Let’s assume that it is some digital content. Then the provider of the digital content and its consumer will reflect their cash flow for the content in the first blockchain, and will store the transactions leading to payment in the application blockchain. By using such an architecture, the platform can adjust to a rate of a thousand transactions per second.

The first blockchain is for operations with WISE tokens (fast transactions, PoW), the second blockchain is for the application catalog with lockout WISE in favor of application users (scaling, DPoS / PoW). This separation allows WISEPLAT to conduct fast transactions with WISE tokens and provide effective scalability for applications.  SCALABILITY Using multiple blockchains allows the blockchain system WISEPLAT to easily scale under increasing loads.  REMOVE THE LIMITATIONS OF SMART CONTRACTS WISEPLAT allows the creation of smart contracts that will exchange data with external data sources, which greatly expands the capabilities of blockchain applications. Contracts can be executed between different blockchains.  ANONYMOUS ACCOUNTS + CONFIRMATION BY THE OWNER Using the account verification system will allow users for their accounts by their own get the status of identifiable accounts.  TRUST WISEPLAT implements the APP Store for its blockchain applications. The use of rating assessments of the application allows users to quickly and safely in most cases choose the application.",False
