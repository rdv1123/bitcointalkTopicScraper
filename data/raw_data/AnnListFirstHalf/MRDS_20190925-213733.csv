I think there should be an improvement in the management of an ICO, never interested when the project indicates a scam, because it can make dev feel annoyed and can not get investors.

Machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning - those are actually different things. First of all, for those unfamilliar with these things or just heard it somewhere, I really recommend to watch Nvidia GTC 2017 on their official Youtube channel, what Jensen Huang tells about AI, and some of the examples. Even for those who not technical, it's very fun to watch. And as specialist in deep learning i can say that what they say is quite accurate and state-of-the art in AI field. They put a great effort to make GPUs for deep learning, it's kinda hard to say what they focused more on these days, gaming or deep learning...  Machine learning (or data science, data mining) usually means such things as cluster analysis, staticstical methods, and neural networks. Although when you see ""machine learning"" it's usually means some simple neural networks or statistical methods without using neural networks. Those things are working fine on CPUs.  Deep learning, on the other hand, is the edge of artificial intelligence right now, and this is the task Volta GPUs with tensor cores were developed for. These neural networks are deep in terms of layers. If in perceptron there's 3 layers (or actually 1, not counting input and output), in deep net it's not surprise to see more than 100 high-dimensional layers (tensors). It's very computational intensive. People waiting for weeks to train one such net on several Titan GPUs, and it's just for one experiment, with parameters that can be optimized for speed, not for accuracy, because it's already takes too long. Exaples of such networks are ResNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet(if interested, google vggnet first). Application includes autonomus driving, photorealistic scene and face generation, understanding and reasonong about scene, and a lot of other things. I'm personally working VQA, something that can lead to universal AI, applicable to any field, like our own intelligence. When i've tried to create tensor in Torch with algo from a paper that was interesting to me, it said that i don't have enough ram. It asked for something like 50 gigs of ram. So i've been forced to change the code and reduce the size of tensor just to be able to launch the script. Therefore, if i'll have hypootecicaly unlimited computational power i would try different configuration of neural network architecture, datasets, and other hypermarameters. Without need to wait for month to see the result of my experiment, i'll launch multiple experiment in parallel, tweaking my code, see what's works. Computational power is the main constraint in this field, so the demand is huge, if not say infinite.  The term Artificial Intelligence is more broader, it describes the entire field of intellectual systems and often serves in marketing purposes, because many scientists hate that term, because it's too sci-fi and bring back memories of high-demand-low-deliver. There's a field of AI called Knowlege Engineering, which usualy means creating the Expert System that will give the same conclusion as an Expert in the corresponding field, using knowlege base created by developers. For example, system asks you for some symptoms and give you recomendations on treatment. If it's unsure, it'll ask additional questions. You can ask it to describe why it gave such recommendation. This type of AI doesn't require machine learning or significant computational power. Only a lot of human work is required, which may be the one reason it didn't became very popular.",False

Well, at least from what i've read. AI projects i've seen are focused on such things as creating distributed AI themselves, or creating distributed app store, or data mining from other people phones, etc, and monetizing everything. On the one hand, it's sound a little utopic, and on the other hand, monetizing can be a fail idea. In this industry there is a lot of big and comperhensive datasets for many tasks (ImgeNet, MS-COCO, etc), which are free and constantly improving by community, many new specific datasets created using these ones. A broader datasets is one of the thinks that are in big demand to create more sophisticated, universal AI. Monetizing it wouldn't be popular. The same with source code for many algos that available on github to improve and use it in own work (no plagiarsm, ofc). Decentralized AI - well, you just invest in AI algo developed by startup. The success of it is questionable, and it's limits, the qualification of team and their goals in the future...  In Myriads.IO, on the other hand, there's no AI development or monetizing something that already open-source, free, and developing with rocket speed. They propose exactly the thing needed for AI research in general and scientists in particular. GPU power. Miners want to sell a lot of it, AI researches wants a lot of it, cheaper*. And not just miners, AI scientists have GPUs too, it might be handy to rent it 24/7, and use the platform when you actually have some experiment to conduct, without touching the ""farm"".  *I can confirm that it's often just too expensive to use current cloud GPUs for experiments, as said in the video. I don't have enough GPU power to train my nets efficiently,  but i'm not ready to pay for amazon or nvidia gpu cloud, it's just expensive as hell (much more than you can theoretically mine with such GPU power), i'll better wait for my local GPU. There's a big gap between young AI enhusiasts that don't get paid much for their science interest and big companies which can pay for these servers easily",False

It is critically important to verify work because miners can send fake results, fake predictions and get rewards for nothing. Miners should get rewards for useful job, for models creation and verifications according to special Ethereum smart contract. Verification Nodes use combination of PoW + PoS, we add proof-of-stake acting as a second authentication mechanism to prevent fake verifications. The incentive of the miner is only to maximize their own profits. So anyone of verifications miners could send illegal fake approves for machine learning work. But stake holders not interested to make fake verifications to prevent MRDS coins price drop. Also we add algorithm that can use the set some circumstances under which a bad validator might lose their deposit. It is the most advanced protection technology. End-Users can assess predictive performance and Verification Nodes adjust rewards according to ML model that End-Users use.",False
