First, provide a permanent, secure and cheap mechanism to establish indelible records which relate original works with their copyright holders. This relation is built through customizable copyright licenses on a certain moment in time. The original work is not stored on the blockchain but a cryptographic digest of it, allowing the copyright holder to keep its work in secret if desired. Second, Engraved also constitutes a system for file integrity verification, where file distributors can register files with their checksums under a custom namespace if desired.
