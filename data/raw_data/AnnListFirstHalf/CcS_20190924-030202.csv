Currently I'm living in Florence and working in a Dr. Silvio Bessone's project (The Block-to-Bar project) as Project Manager. Silvio Bessone is the CTO of ""Fine Cocoa Research Institute"", and currently we are working to implement a new method of fermentation of the cocoa beans to get the best from very single cocoa bean. The method is called ""Bessone Patented Method"" (BMP). The BMP allows a grade of fermentation of 100%, that means that every single cocoa bean of every batch suffer a process of fermentation with the bacterium chosen to get the most in aroma and flavor.  This kind of cocoa will be placed in the market with a higher quotation.  I can declare:  1) We are going to implement (through the Bit&Nibs foundation in Venezuela) the BMP with the farmers that will work with the cocoa trees of Analema group (the group behind the ICO of Cacaoshare).  2) We are looking for a system of traceability of the all cocoa fermented with BMP, and we are studying to use the system of Analema Group.  3) I'm going to use the Cacaoshare to change the algorithm of Chococoin from Proof of Work to a new one Proof of Tree. This change of algorithm will allow finally that the Chococoin will be backed with a real asset (Chocolate).  4) Dr. Silvio Bessone met Patino Jose Alejandro in Tokyo and Patino shown the first documents asked by Dr. Bessone to consider any join venture with the Analema group.",False

We know 4 years means some time for the crypto world, but precisely that is what gives inherent value to the CcS (specially to the first edition) it is sustented by a real growing asset (in all sense), we cannot say the same about mineral commodities or other digital assets built on more subtle expectations.  You can use CcS to hedge risk in your portfolio respect to other cryptos that are more volatile.  For example your CcS is worth 0.36$ today how much will it be when the tree is about 2 years old and we have the data that shows it s condition?   Let the market say!  I know for some, Chocolate business may come as a surprise or even ludicrous but Cacao has a solid supply and demand market and has been there for years, we are not necessarily inventing the wheel, just making it blockchain transparent!  There are different motivations to support CcS, one is the interest in the simple yield over the Cacao Trees but there are also those who know the problems and scarcity of Cacao Criollo varieties and want to participate in saving its biodiversity, there are also those who dream with this kind of rare Cacao (luxury chocolatiers) and want to make sure they get some for their exclusive use  You can see above the comments of German regarding Silvio, he is one who knows too the situation of Cacao Criollo, we are lucky to be talking with him  thanks again for your analysis  Patino @ cacaoshares",False

Tagged for Real time traceability of its yield and its genetics. We also have already completed a minimal viable pototype of this app and will be available for beta testing to early contributors  The Cacao Industry has structural problems, particularly the Fine Cacao grown in Venezuela and exported to Japan suffers from low yield and poor productivity because of aging trees and gaps in management  CCS allows People to Invest In the Future of Cacao Trees As Chocolate Becomes Popular In Japan. By using the blockchain Technology we can solve two major problems of the Cacao industry: Traceability and Availability. Our goal is to plant 1 million new Cacao Criollo Trees and tag them to the Blockchain for perfect traceability  Only 1,388,888 CcS will be offered on preSALE @ 47% discount plus bonus of 5% for 1 ETH or more and 10% for 10 ETH or more.  ====================================================== ======================================================  Theobroma Cacao is an outstanding tree species that is vital to the production of chocolate among other foods. The bean is grown in many parts of the world, but it is in Venezuela where it truly stands out. Venezuelan cacao, known as Cacao Criollo is considered to be the most biodiverse cacao in the world. It has especially become a big deal in Japan where 50% of Venezuelan Exports of Cacao representing 10% of the Total Market Share of Cacao Imports into Japan.  ====================================================== ======================================================  It is with this that a CacaoShares ICO is being set up to support the development of cacao trees in Venezuela. Cacao Shares has been set up as an exciting program. The ICO is being backed by numerous people with strong experience in today’s investment field.  An extensive team is currently supporting criollo Sur Del Lago Tokens. Jose Alejandro Patino is the main coordinator of the program. He is an entrepreneur who has been working in the IT sector since 2002. Nakata Hiro, a Japanese entrepreneur with more than twenty years of experience in the food industry, is also a big part of the program. Foreign trade expert Rafael Devia is also participating.  The ICO will help to raise funds to get the Criollo type tree in Sur Del Lago in Venezuela grown and then exported out to Japan. This is a country where the cacao beans are highly valued. Asia has become one of the top consumers of cacao in recent years.  ====================================================== ======================================================  Every share that a person acquires during the ICO will be good for the quota of the entire life of a cacao tree. The sponsor of a tree will be rewarded based on the productivity of that tree . This comes as the value of the Fine Cacao Beans has become greater in recent time.  ====================================================== ======================================================  The ICO is based on the Ethereum blockchain. All Cacao trees will be tagged with physical sensors to monitor how well the trees are producing cacao and how they are being  harvested and sent out to Japan. This helps to identify the varieties of Cacao and how well the trees are growing beans. The above is called traceability and it is highly valued in the Cacao Trade.  The shares being offered will entail ownership of a fixed asset. The people who own Cacao Shares own the trees in question. This works to not only help the economy but to also promote social responsibility through the development of  trees it is expected to help the communities involved to have livelihood for many years .  Additional information on the Cacao Shares ICO can be found online at www.cacaoshares.com.

We have not planned any bounties yet, but if you have some suggestions on a bounties scheme that will make it more attractive for you and for fellow crypto enthusiasts we should consider it  Have you some projections about the Return of Invest on the next years?  We are updating the terms to fit the regulations on Cryptos, This shall be ready this week but the rationale is as follows:  1 cacao tree will store 100 CacaoShares, 1 cacao tree has a peak productive life of 25 years up to a 100 years, 1 cacao tree can produce about 1 to 2 kg of Cacao in its peak productivity The cacao beans will be sold and exported and the revenues converted into Tokens (of new trees, separate tokens) that will be awarded to the owners of the ""original"" tokens, those secondary and tertiary assets can be exchanged freely as well for other cryptos of fiat The owner of the Cacao can also claim ""in kind"" 1 kilo or whatever his tree produces once a year. we will know because of the App that will report continuously the situation of each tree  In conclusion, if one CacaoShare costs you 50 cents then a Tree will cost 50$ and will produce at least 50 kilos of Fine Cacao that fetches retail price of 50$ (In Tokyo), so   50 x 50 = 2500$  The productivity declines after year 25. Just as a reference the existing trees are 40, 60 years old  Have you any form or database to get listed and receive more info?  please go in the www.cacaoshares.com website and you will see a popup for enrolling to be notified ahead the PRE-Vip sale or write us directly to ico (at) cacaoshares .com  Thank you friend, all the best to you  Alejandro Patino   ",False
