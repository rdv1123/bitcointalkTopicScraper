While we acknowledge that bounties such as signature campaigns can do extremely well, we wanted to do things a bit more organically and attract certain types of investors.  Our ICO is not 'hyped', nor do we want it to be given the current state of the market with 'pump and dump' issues occuring around listing.  Bounties work well for token sales that need to gather a substantial userbase after launching a product. Astronaut does not quite fit into this category. The types of investors into the token sale we are looking for are in it for the long term. Our concern was that a heavy bounty approach may cause large amounts of investors to contribute that may not really understand what we are offering, or are looking to 'head for the door' as soon as possible.  In saying this, we could be proved wrong and time will certainly tell.  Many thanks for your comments all.",False

Some other questions highlighted:  30,000,000 cap  The cap is simply there to show our maximum goal. All remaining tokens will be burned.

One Token To Rule Them All.,"I'm curious about a few things and I'm hoping the Astro rep will be able to answer.  1. Will the total investment be based on the amount raised in the crowdsale? It goes without saying that the more invested the bigger the potential profits for dividends so if only a small amount is invested then the dividends may not be that significant and hence not worth the investment. That being said is there a minimum goal you're going for? I realize it may be difficult, but is it also possible to give an estimate of projected range on the return per coin in different scenarios (i.e. fund does very well, fund does ok, fund does poorly)? Even if you just used fake placeholder numbers, it would allow people to see what kind of benefit they'd be getting based on their investment.    2. I believe on the reasons exchanges like Bittrex haven't added anything in over a month is because of the SEC ruling on securities and since this seems to be a security as well, are there any safeguards to ensure it doesn't change over time. I was looking to invest in ETHBET which is basically the same as ETHROLL, both of which pay dividends from the gambling profits of the platform, but prior to the crowdsale ETHBET completely dropped the dividends portion so it makes the coin much less attractive. I believe in the ASTRO whitepaper it was stated that it will be added to Poloniex shortly after the crowdsale finishes so is there any sort of deal in the works with that since it seems very difficult to get added to anything other than Etherdelta and HitBtc these days and it will affect the coin's value tremendously.  3. I'm a big fan of the reports written by Piccolo research as they are well thought out and logically sound, but I do wonder if coins rated under ""spec buy"" will be invested in. I'm assuming the fund will stay clear of ""avoid"" and I think it's safe to say ones with ""buy"" ratings will be including, but almost all of the coins are given ""spec buy"" which has seen mixed results. For instance, Trueflip is one of the coins rated ""spec buy"" but it is currently about 20% under ICO price and Dao.Casino is also another spec buy coin that hasn't been performing too well either. If the fund is filled with most ""spec buy"" coins then I feel like it will hamper success seeing as spec buy is almost akin to 50/50 in regards to success. In contrast, the only coin under buy, 0x, went 10x until it settled down to around 4x (Chainlink, the other buy coin is too new to judge) so whether the fund will be mainly comprised of coins rated under ""buy"" or ""spec"" will make a huge difference.  4. This might be written in the whitepaper and I missed it, but is the strategy of the fund to buy at ICO and then hold and cash out at a certain multiplier (i.e. 5x or 10x), or just hold indefinitely, or flip for the short term. I saw something about short term and long term investments but I wasn't able to find any specifics on when the value from investing in the coin would be realized. For example, if the fund bought DNT at ICO, when would the profits from DNT be allocated to the fund because at one point it was 10x, but it has fallen down to 3x, so depending on the date when you sold or realized profits there a discrepancy which would greatly affect the dividends.      Thanks.",False

One Token To Rule Them All.,"Thanks for the questions:  1. Expected return and size  Total investment will depends on the amount raised for the crowdsale. For example, if the end amount raised is closer to $15m, position sizing operating costs and everything will be scaled down almost proportionally. The rest of the tokens are burned. Our expectation is to outperform the market significantly. If you look at the returns of some other listed vehicles such as TaaS, market cap has almost tripled in that time with decent performance. Based on our analysis of market return and previous strategy, we are aiming for high ROI even in the first quarter. As you said, the more raised the better.  2. Dividends and exchange  We are currently also looking at a process for DRP, as some token holders are expressing their want to reinvest the total amount. This is understandable and we are hoping to come up with a flexible solution. The listing on exchanges is actually a technical barrier to do with dividend distribution as well. We are currently finalising discussions with a number of exchanges and hoping to release an announcement this week. It is simply a matter of which are the most flexible for ETH contributions to be made every quarter.  3.  Picolo and Spec Buy  Great question.  Spec Buy represents a lower exposure opportunity where conviction isnt 100%, however the rewards outweigh the risks for a short/medium term buy. Simply put, this affects position sizing and length of 'hold.' Astronaut holders will find that the reports released after the token sale (exclusive to them) will be quite a bit different, specifically noting the rationale behind the amount of funds placed, sizing and detailed stop loss.  4. Investment strategy  This is a question we could answer in about 15 pages  Ultimately it comes down to the following:  a) protecting risk. when a position pops in the market and significant capital gains are had, we implement a Stop Loss strategy to cash out of any existing risk therefore making it a free trade. This protects downside risk and keep long exposure.  b) continuing to scale out of volatile tokens (if short term). This comes down to raising stop loss and exit points as we see market sentiment turn adn volatility increase (or volume decrease)  c) position on the token. The above really depends on whether or not a long or short term view is made (which token holders will be advised). High conviction buys will generally be a longer term opportunity that we forecast significant +1000% growth. This means a different risk and holding strategy. The short term component employs a more active approach.  I hope this answers some of your questions - if it hasn't just let me know",False

One Token To Rule Them All.,"Today we present Astronaut (ASTRO) WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER  Astronaut is an innovative new ICO which seeks to close the inefficiencies of prospective investors filtering, researching and ultimately investing in ICOs.  In short, Astronaut allows you to invest in one token, which in turn gives you ownership to the best, verified, and researched backed ICOs every month.  Quick brief Astronaut’s tokens (ASTRO) provides two kinds of returns to its users:  1) Token appreciation aligned with the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund; and  2) Quarterly income distributions based on the investment and exit activity of Astronaut  Astronaut will be the first to establish such a platform in the crypto community, offering efficiency and flexibility, whilst also giving investors the desired exposure to the crypto asset class without any of the ongoing transactional pain points.   Where did Astronaut come from? Astronaut is a creation based on the needs and wants of our subscribers at Picolo Research http://www.picoloresearch.com  Astronaut owns and operates Picolo Research, a top tier research firm specialising in institutional grade research for new Initial Coin Offerings. Picolo is independent and does not receive remuneration for its recommendations.  Following a series of interviews and feedback from our 10,000+ subscribers, we were confronted with the inefficiencies that every-day people experience when trying to gain exposure to the right ICOs at the right time. It was at this moment that Astronaut was born.    What makes Astronaut a good token? Utilising our internal research team at Picolo Research, we have a track record of providing investors with real opportunities that are focused on growth and capital return.  Feel free to browse our recommendations and track record by visiting http://www.picoloresearch.com  Over 10,000 crypto investors currently rely on us to perform detailed due diligence and uncover the best opportunities for capital gain.   What is our performance like? Astronaut focuses on growth opportunities that are prime for capital gain. Our mandate is geared towards investment that has a significant chance of a liquidity event (exit) within 1-6 months of capital injection.  Over the last quarter, Astronaut has completed public due diligence reports on twelve new Initial Coin Offerings which have satisfied its filtering and market-scanning process. Out of the twelve ICO due diligence reports, four of them have been disregarded as ‘Avoid’ based on further analysis.  Of the eight investments that we have deployed capital in over the last quarter, two of them have listed on major exchanges and are available for public trading. The remaining six are all scheduled to commence trading in the coming months, however they are also currently listed on secondary markets and available to trade over-the-counter (OTC).     How does Astronaut choose what to invest in? Astronaut takes a methodical approach to investment utilizing its experience within the private equity markets and small-cap (pink sheets) sectors.  With our experience in analysing concept stage and pre-revenue startups, the team bases their research analysis off several fundamental and technical factors such as:  • Management and team track record  • Structure of the token  • Capital spent to date  • Anticipated capital to be raised  • Use of proceeds raised  • Current intellectual property  • History of development  • History of commercialization  • Commercial viability of the project  • Professionalism and credibility of the organization  • Market demand and anticipated liquidity  • Company structures and incorporation  Our analysts utilize a number of algorithms and API feeds to screen and shortlist all upcoming ICOs. From this point forward, our shortlist is examined, researched and calculated using a scoring system developed internally.    How does the Token Sale work of ASTRO? Astronaut believes that the power of the tokens lies with their holders, which will continue to provide the demand, support and liquidity within the ecosystem. In light of this, all tokens, bar a small percentage, will be offered to the market, with the remainder used as an incentive for the Investment Committee (IC) who are actively researching and executing the opportunities.  There will be 30,000,000 tokens issued as a one-off. After this time, there will be no more tokens issued.    Leftover tokens will be burned  Any tokens that are not sold through the crowd sale or allocated as per above will be burned. In this instance, ICO investors will receive a lower entry price proportional to the amount of tokens remaining.  Operating costs and development of portfolio infrastructure  As Astronaut is a close-ended fund structure, it will be subject to certain operating costs for the life of the token. In light of this, there will be a small allocation of funds to be used over time to pay for operating expenses, investment analysts and the completion of its Astronaut Portfolio Tracker apps and auditing tools.  92% of funds will be deployed strictly into investment to achieve token holder income and capital growth 8% of funds will be utilised for ongoing operating costs (auditing, legal, terminals) including the completion of our portfolio tools for token holders. This portion from the initial sale is budgeted to last for the life of the token. *2% additional management fee will apply per annum for the ongoing administration of the Astronaut platform (this will only come into effect after the initial 12 months to assist with any extra operating costs)  How does the Token Sale work of ASTRO? As part of the Astronaut income strategy, holders of the token are entitled to receive quarterly dividends based on the performance of realised investments over that period.  The breakup of the distribution is as follows:  50% of ‘realised’ profits via Astronaut investment activities will be credited back to the token holder in ETH on a quarterly basis 40% of the profit will be reinvested into Astronaut, therefore expanding assets under management (AUM) and appreciating the token price of ASTRO 10% of the profit each quarter will be used to fund the ongoing operation of Astronaut and its investment activities (legal, auditing, analysis)    Exchange tradable Astro Tokens Astronaut will be issuing ASTRO Tokens (ASTRO) to its token holders after the initial coin offering. Our expectation is that ASTRO will be tradable on the exchange within six weeks of issue. Investment will begin as soon as the ICO has completed in order to get ahead of the market.  Based on performance of our previous investment efforts, recommendations, market comparisons and outlook in the short term, we anticipate significant growth and appreciation of ASTRO stating November 2017.   The Astronaut Portfolio Tracker Astronaut is developing an intuitive and detailed portfolio tracking system, allowing investors to quickly gain transparency of the Assets Under Management (AUM), transactions and dividend periods at the push of a button.  The application will be the knowledge base for investors seeking to gain an understanding of potential investment decisions that Astronaut will be making.   Upcoming dividend notifier  The application alerts investors of the details regarding quarterly dividend distribution including the amount, yield, highest/lowest performers and the expected date of receipt.  Daily and weekly AUM balancing  While the Astro Tokens will be traded publicly, the Astronaut Portfolio Tracker will calculate AUM on a periodic basis to determine the true underlying value of each Astro token. While there may be a small pricing disparity due to outside factors (either higher or lower in the public market), this AUM calculation will give a true indication of token value.  Research and analysis  The application allows investors to access the underlying research and investment methodology that was used in the process of each transaction. This research is conducted by our internal team at Picolo Research. Investors will be notified each time there is a new report, commentary or analysis uploaded on the application.  Transaction notifier  When Astronaut places a new transaction, alerts are sent to the investor through the Portfolio Tracker. This will also detail the exposure that is set as a (%) of the overall AUM.  Auditing & security  Astronaut is focused on providing our token holders with the right tools and platforms to evaluate transactions, portfolio performance, liquidity levels and dividends on demand. We believe trust can only come in the form of complete transparency in the decentralised ecosystem.  Exchange selection which satisfies Proof of Solvency  Astronaut is committed to only using exchanges that can satisfy the Proof of Solvency test (PoS) .  This ensures specific liquidity and reserve fund requirements that give piece of mind to investors and institutions dealing with exchange platforms. To date, there is a select number of exchanges on our approved list such as Kraken and Poloniex.  Open API for viewing and account auditing  Astronaut will establish viewer access APIs to provide the highest degree of transparency regarding fund allocation, holdings and current investments.  Holders of the token will have access to a real-time view of every investment, in every exchange on demand.  Fiat account transparency  As a certain portion of funds remain in fiat for liquidity reserves, Astronaut will be implementing a viewer access portal linked direct to the bank API for on-demand access to fiat balances and incoming/outgoing transactions.

It doesn't have time to build momentum.

So I got curious - like this no one is going to know about it fast enough to provide enough interested investors - and no due dilligence report can come out before that juicy Presale period is over.  So what do I think? Most important - the team.  6 people to manage 30 million. Ok.  1st of them (the commander) has 2 articles he's written as a reference + a twitter link that does not work. 2nd of them has only their parent company (which hasn't been active for too long) as reference. 3rd of them has a twitter and a linked in page. Neither Astronaut nor Picolo research is mentioned anywhere there. 4th one has one linked in page - again Picolo/Astronaut nowhere to be mentioned 5th one again only picolo as reference 6th one finally a twitter account that actually mentions astronaut. And a FB account that has limited access.  Welp.  The concept can be as interesting as it wants. You are not going to get me to invest in this when the team is split in  a) no real reference b) loaded with so many projects that they don't even bother to mention this one on there profiles  Also, wthe ""commander"" has written 2 articles on 2 different sites in his lifetime and his only other reference is a twitter link that doesn't work. If that is the most well documented team member.  Well then reading that whitepaper was a waste of time. You guys can do this without me.  Peace and out.  (Edit: I mean come on, I can write to articles on medium, then go ahead and collect 30 million from people or what? I'm sure I'd be making a positive ROI with your investment too in this market.)",False
