Recurrent profits simply holding tokens without adding extra funds. Already +27% gain with on the Forex BETA account.   The investment is going to be appreciated due following points:  Increased Token Demand Based on our experience with Fox Binary Signals, we have determined that interest in our trading algorithm increases every month linked to it’s profitability. Additionally, new users will need to purchase tokens to gain access to services and current users will need to hold it to keep the lifetime access. All these points combined create an unstoppable demand and drive up the price of the FOXT token.   Deflationary token After every payment of FOXT tokens made on the Fox Trading platform by new users, a small amount of those tokens will be burned, making the Fox Trading Token a deflationary currency. This mechanism ensures the growth of Fox Trading token value which will incentivize long-term holding of the currency by investors.  Regards,  Fox Trading Team",True

The two points that will guarantee the price increase are:  Increased Token Demand Based on our experience with Fox Binary Signals, we have determined that interest in our trading algorithm increases every month linked to it’s profitability. Additionally, new users will need to purchase tokens to gain access to services and current users will need to hold it to keep the lifetime access. All these points combined create an unstoppable demand and drive up the price of the FOXT token.   Deflationary token After every payment of FOXT tokens made on the Fox Trading platform by new users, a small amount of those tokens will be burned, making the Fox Trading Token a deflationary currency. This mechanism ensures the growth of Fox Trading token value which will incentivize long-term holding of the currency by investors.",True

Honestly in my opinion is one of the best ICO's out there. The trading platform itself is also simple to use.  I have two inquiries with regards to your auto trading system, and the 15% that are invested on the trading pool which is going to provide benefits to the token holders.   Will your auto trading system remain on low risk setting? Will there be an option for high riskers to copy your high risk trades instead of low risks for bigger potential rewards? Or will it always remain on low risk setting?  The 15% invested on the trading pool will provide benefits to token holder, so the profit from the 15% trading pool, will be given to token holders, IN ADDITION to the profit on fee's that is also being given to the holders? Or is the benefit of holding the tokens come only from the 15% trading pool?  All in all, a highly recommended ICO! Good job and thank you for the opportunity!",True

Do you hold off on dividend payments until the pool is in the green?! Yes this is right but for legal reasons we are not going to give dividends, only share profits from tradinf pool.  Does your auto-trading feature replicate the trading pool’s decisions, in a separate account for that individual trader? Or is the auto-trading feature personalized? You can follow trading pool features, but for example you will be able to change the size of the entry or the leverage, and also stop loss.  You say “the automatic trading system means that the trader ‘teaches’ the software what signals to search and how to interpret them”, which sounds fascinating. Though how does that work in practice? Yes, you will be able to select in which trades you want to participate.  Thank you very much for your time,",True

From what I could gather from the white paper and the foxtrading.io homepage, a portion of the ICO will go towards a pool that will be used by your algorithm to trade. Those trades will be executed automatically. 75% of the gains from those trades will be paid to token holders as a dividend.  Is that correct?  If that is correct, what happens if the trading algorithm goes red? Do you hold off on dividend payments until the pool is in the green?!  Does your auto-trading feature replicate the trading pool’s decisions, in a separate account for that individual trader? Or is the auto-trading feature personalized?  You say “the automatic trading system means that the trader ‘teaches’ the software what signals to search and how to interpret them”, which sounds fascinating. Though how does that work in practice?

We are not aiming to be big on that, we will limit the number of users to avoid affecting the market, we don´t want quantity, we want quality of the trades and success of our users.  If you are afraid about the machines, they already exist, they are called high frequency machines and are the ones that control the market on Forex, they are managed by few investors (hedge funds). Have a look here for more info. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading  This is part of the thread on wikipedia:  On the early 2000s, high-frequency trading still accounted for fewer than 10% of equity orders, but this proportion was soon to begin rapid growth. According to data from the NYSE, trading volume grew by about 164% between 2005 and 2009 for which high-frequency trading might be accounted. As of the first quarter in 2009, total assets under management for hedge funds with high-frequency trading strategies were $141 billion, down about 21% from their peak before the worst of the crises, although most of the largest HFT's are actually LLC's owned by a small number of investors. The high-frequency strategy was first made popular by Renaissance Technologies who use both HFT and quantitative aspects in their trading. Many high-frequency firms are market makers and provide liquidity to the market which lowers volatility and helps narrow bid-offer spreads, making trading and investing cheaper for other market participants.
