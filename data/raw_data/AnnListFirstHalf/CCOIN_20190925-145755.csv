Flatlay is on a mission to support the global democratization of commerce with technology. The team's focus is on making e-commerce monetization accessible to anyone by removing the borders & restrictions for global participation. The blockchain-based network enables content creators, brands & publishers to interact securely without restriction versus the legacy marketplace infrastructures & regulations of today.  The platform revolves around the implementation of Creditcoin (CCOIN), a cryptocurrency token designed atop of ethereum to incentivize community members & curators collaborating to building wealth within the community.   Flatlay gets products to the right creatives in 3 easy steps:  1. Create an account and begin sharing your products 2. Search and invite creatives to campaigns 3. Creatives build posts and collections with items   Flatlay is a marketplace where users, brands & retailers securely trade between one another in a decentralized environment. The platform incentivizes users to mutually benefit & engage in the cooperative support of Flatlay member shops. Anyone can use the secure platform to promote & purchase products from one another while partnering with validated merchants & suppliers in the network.  The Flatlay credits System guarantees any users contributing to the creation of social value in the platform is rewarded in Creditcoin (CCOIN). CCOIN is an ERC20 token utilized in the community to reward sales & compensate campaign promotions across the web, facilitating the organic growth of the Flatlay community. Flatlay creates a gateway between Creditcoin & the real world by offering an instant access debit card to be used anywhere.   What is Creditcoin?  Creditcoin(CCOIN) tokens are used to facilitate trade & exchange on the network by supporting campaign promotions, incentivized interactions & sales across the web frictionlessly.  CCOIN functions as a digital currency & rewards mechanism compensating users adding value to the community by performing particular functions. These activities can be sharing or promoting an item to others, launching products in market or broadcasting a livestream that requests contributions of ccoin for exclusive access to content & product. CCOIN ensures the growth of the Flatlay marketplace & network while being designed to scale quickly to support steady global expansion. An important attribute incorporated into the viral nature of the network is that CCOIN facilitates cooperation between brands & users engaging with audiences & sub-communities on particular verticals.  An example would be a popular photographer or videographer with a respected online audience using FLATLAY. There would be numerous fans, followers & brands interested in his or her gear recommendations. in one instance, the content creator would quickly create a collection of product recommendations from the millions of items made available to them on the FLATLAY affiliate network. They do so in anticipation of sharing the collection with an audience to earn CCOIN on any purchases influenced.  In another scenario, a particular camera brand is interested in working with this same user to promote product(s) in a compensated collaboration where they're seeding goods in order to create original content that incorporates it. The user shares the promotion with their audience & is compensated in additional CCOIN by the brand along with earning affiliate revenue generated from sales. This further incentivizes content creators to continue working with brands beyond the initial promotion to amplify CCOIN  earnings.  In a final scenario, the content creator has a large audience & has an interest to launch their own private-label product (i.e. leather camera strap, branded lens protector, etc.) directly to consumers. FLATLAY provides the needed infrastructure & publishing tools to facilitate interest in the product while supporting purchases. Pre-production costs are greatly reduced while sales & marketing campaigns are natively done in real-time, all while maximizing earnings generated & distributed in CCOIN .  All scenarios support earnings continuously flowing back into the pool helping this limitless cycle of contribution on multiple levels & verticals. The same economics & logic for affiliate payouts in CCOIN are applied to platforms & marketplaces looking to streamline payout distribution & logistics between shoppers, affiliate marketers & online retailers.   The Flatlay Interactive Card   One of the core innovative features of Flatlay is the Flatlay interactive card (FLIC). It allows users to directly increase the value associated with a published FLIC post by binding collections of shoppable products embedded with a mark & unique link supporting affiliate revenue generated from sales. As users disburse FLICs across social media platforms & the web, visibility & the interactions with each increase the social value & monetization potential behind each FLIC. Thus, users are incentivized to create high-quality content that converts & engages whether it lives on or off the platform.       FLICs contain information auto-embed from the system to help identify content with a digital watermark encryption invisible to the naked eye. It's leveraged in cases where content is distributed & author authentication for payout attribution is needed. This is incredibly relevant when the rights for content usage of a FLIC are requested by third parties (brands & publishers as advertisers).  FLICs facilitate information flow between content creators, brands & publishers while promoting transparency. Flatlay leverages the blockchain & smart contract system in the FLIC verification protocol to safeguard original creators from duplication or fraudulent use of content. FLICs are a patent-pending innovation.   Pre-ICO Token Sale Pre-sale is limited to 25,000 ETH and 4 weeks. If the pre-sale is completed before the four week time limit, it will be immediately closed. Bonuses are booked according to arrival times & will be disbursed from Flatlay?s share of CCoin.   CCOIN ICO  Creditcoin (CCOIN) will begin with a supply of 100,000,000 units. A total supply of 100,000,000 CCOIN)are being issued for the ICO, out of which 70,000,000 are distributed to ICO contributors. The remaining 30,000,000 are reserved for enhanced growth & continued development of Flatlay through marketing. rewarding active community members & supporting new product launches that the community is interested are major focuses to be managed by Flatlay Inc. The maximum ICO cap is 50,000 ETH. In the ICO campaign, for every 5,000 ETH reserved we plan to rollout marketplace support in an additional geographic region & audience vertical.  The goal is to lean on early adopters while building anticipation & excitement for marketplace support globally.  ICO Fund Dispersion  What's To Come?

It's an exciting breakthrough technology & cryptographic token in a decentralized marketplace owned by the users of the community.",False
