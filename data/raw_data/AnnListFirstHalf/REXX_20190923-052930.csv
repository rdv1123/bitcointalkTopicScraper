Tanya|Rexpax Team: Rexpax Pre-ICO Short Summary  Dear friends!  📢We would like to declare that the stage of Rexpax Token Pre-sale has come to an end. In this message we want to make some important announcements.📢  ✨First of all, we want to thank everyone who got inspired by the Idea of Home Online and shared his positive feedback about Rexpax in social networks. We highly appreciate it and will do our best to satisfy all your expectations.✨  📌By the results of REXX token Pre-sale we managed to get 5.0283 ETH from 14 investors. We are thankful to every participant. ❗️All investments will be returned to the owners by December 25th, 2017.❗️  📌We should currently abandon the process of running the Initial Coin Offering, as preparations demand vast investments in marketing but, as the results of pre-sale show, Rexpax is not able to afford such expenses.  📌We fully realize and have analyzed all the mistakes that were made by us during the pre-sale stage preparations. Despite all that, we will move on to the further development and project launch, as Rexpax is the Idea that inspires us to stay strong in the pursuit of the goals.  📌Our bounty-campaign is called off. We regret to announce that the project didn’t manage to fund the quantity of investments sufficient for rewarding Bounties for their actions in Social Media. We thank all the participants of Rexpax bounty campaign and apologize for any inconvenience and the situation created. Your job is not for nothing — due to your activities, many people were reached by the idea of World’s first Home Online. We hereby declare that Rexpax Bounty Campaign is shut down.  ✨We once again thank everyone who gave us their positive responses about the Rexpax Project. Your actions and reviews motivate us a lot and prove that we chose the right way to follow. And we want to convince you of the happy final of everything we do. You can be sure of that. Stay tuned to our updates in social media and chats: we are always happy to communicate with our fellow-thinkers, share our achievements and plans, discuss the project’s details and see the useful criticism correcting the mistakes. Thank you so much!✨  📝Our future plans are clear and transparent: we plan to continue the development and finally launch the product whatever it takes. We are currently focused on searching for venture investments and ready to consider each particular investment offer individually.  Stay with us in social networks and chats!  👑Rexpax. World without locks.👑",False
