Let me preface that any of these other blockchain technologies or ICOs are all great companies and ideas, and the Morpheus.Network is just a completely different platform.  Also, given the success of any given technology, we would look into integrating that blockchain as a “sidechain” as a part of a Morpheus Network Smart Contract.  The Morpheus Network is designed to be utilized by the global trade, or import/export industry.  That is how the platform’s automation features are designed including the methods of payment transfers offered by the Morpheus Network to drive the 15 trillion dollar global trade industry  Origin Trail – This is another amazing concept.  Similar elements in the use of blockchain to record, maintain and source the origin of where globally shipped goods come from.  Completely different without any elements of a payment system or automating supply chain.  ShipChain & IMMLA  – These are 2 great companies and teams.  Trucking and multiple transportation services blockchain technologies but very different since no automating supply chain with a global payment system.  Sweet Bridge – They really have an amazing site with an extremely knowledgeable team.  They have a heavy focus on lending funds based on ones’ assets, which is a great platform, but much different than our platform’s model of automating processes in a supply chain as objectives in a Smart Contract.   CargoX - Another awesome project. Their concentration on the document generation and sharing between parties is a Morpheus.Network feature as well. The Morpheus platform has more document generation capabilities (work contracts and more) as well as the means to execute these contracts as a part of an automated Smart Contract. Along with our payment system, it really sets us apart  TenX / Monetha / other payment systems –  There are so many crypto based payment systems with talented and motivated teams.  Their business models are heavily focused on the retail market.  For buying a set of headphones or a coffee at a cafe, they may be better options.   Eximchain - Another wonderful project, but our payment system is multilayered allowing different payment flow possibilities. Also, our project is dealing with supply chain inefficiencies by focusing more on automating the global trade system.  Once again we love these projects and we fully believe in interoperability between technologies to fully optimize the global supply chain and the success of the Morpheus.Network can be parallel to their success, and not in competition with it.",False

Let me preface that any of these other blockchain technologies or ICOs are all great companies and ideas, and the Morpheus.Network is just a completely different platform.  Also, given the success of any given technology, we would look into integrating that blockchain as a “sidechain” as a part of a Morpheus Network Smart Contract.  The Morpheus Network is designed to be utilized by the global trade, or import/export industry.  That is how the platform’s automation features are designed including the methods of payment transfers offered by the Morpheus Network to drive the 15 trillion dollar global trade industry  Origin Trail – This is another amazing concept.  Similar elements in the use of blockchain to record, maintain and source the origin of where globally shipped goods come from.  Completely different without any elements of a payment system or automating supply chain.  ShipChain & IMMLA  – These are 2 great companies and teams.  Trucking and multiple transportation services blockchain technologies but very different since no automating supply chain with a global payment system.  Sweet Bridge – They really have an amazing site with an extremely knowledgeable team.  They have a heavy focus on lending funds based on ones’ assets, which is a great platform, but much different than our platform’s model of automating processes in a supply chain as objectives in a Smart Contract.   CargoX - Another awesome project. Their concentration on the document generation and sharing between parties is a Morpheus.Network feature as well. The Morpheus platform has more document generation capabilities (work contracts and more) as well as the means to execute these contracts as a part of an automated Smart Contract. Along with our payment system, it really sets us apart  TenX / Monetha / other payment systems –  There are so many crypto based payment systems with talented and motivated teams.  Their business models are heavily focused on the retail market.  For buying a set of headphones or a coffee at a cafe, they may be better options.   Eximchain - Another wonderful project, but our payment system is multilayered allowing different payment flow possibilities. Also, our project is dealing with supply chain inefficiencies by focusing more on automating the global trade system.  Once again we love these projects and we fully believe in interoperability between technologies to fully optimize the global supply chain and the success of the Morpheus.Network can be parallel to their success, and not in competition with it.",False

Let me preface that any of the other blockchain technologies or ICOs are all great companies and ideas, and the Morpheus Network is just a completely different platform.  Also, given the success of any given technology, we would look into integrating that blockchain as a “sidechain” as a part of a Morpheus Network Smart Contract.  The Morpheus Network is designed to be utilized by the global trade, or import/export industry. That is how the platform’s automation features are designed including the methods of payment transfers offered by the Morpheus Network to drive the 15 trillion dollar global trade industry.  Origin Trail is another amazing concept. Similar elements in the use of blockchain to record, maintain and source the origin of where globally shipped goods come from. Completely different without any elements of a payment system or automating supply chain.  We truly believe that the success of the Morpheus Network can be parallel to the success of other great ICOs, and not in competition with it.",False
