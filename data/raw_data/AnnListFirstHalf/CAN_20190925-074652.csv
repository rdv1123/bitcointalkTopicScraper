So, naturally, Care.Coin is going to be used as a unified payment for all the parties of the platform: • Care.Coin understands relationships • Brings accountability to healthcare billings • Handles long lifecycle of healthcare transactions • Implements proof-of-service • Easy audit, reconciliation, adjustment & recovery • Fights fraud, waste and abuse that fiat can not",False

Administrative and health information technology costs are high around the world. IT systems that run the growing number of administrative functions continue to become more cumbersome and costly.  There are numerous documented facts that show the current health information technology infrastructure has become less interoperable and unable to deal with the increased demand by both providers and consumers of health care services. All these factors lead to an increasing share of total health care spend being allocated to core administrative functions.  That’s where Solve.Care comes in as a solution to many of the problems associated with health care administration and the wide range of functions required to administer health benefits in a seamless and cost effective manner with greater efficiency.,False
