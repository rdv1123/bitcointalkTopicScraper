According to economic theory, Etherparty had a flaw in the pricing model to the detriment of all. In normal markets when demand is less than supply price drops on a product and the market clears. In Etherparty instead of selling in Fuel, the prices were set in USD. This prevented the market from clearing. In the ICO the stated plan was for the company to sell tokens for no less than $1 which meant that in order to stay in business the price of the token had to rise above $1. This was expected to support the price as users would have to acquire tokens on the market creating demand. The demand never arose for two main reasons. First, many ICO participants intended to spend the tokens in the future. But because these Fuel holders were left with tokens purchased at higher value by the time the products were ready, they were reluctant to spend and crystallize the losses. Instead the user could buy on the market but most would not because this would require new money. Few want to spend with the bad experience of suffering loss.    Now suppose the products were priced in Fuel. They would have become very cheap creating demand. This would have created a powerful incentive to spend Fuel rather than to dump the Fuel on the market with little demand, driving down the price. If you read Jeff Bezos in the Amazon annual reports, when you have a product which has reduced costs at scale, you should price low to build the market share before competitors. Competitors are reluctant to enter because of the prospect of losses. This allowed Amazon to become dominant by pricing only to gain enough gross margin to grow at the maximum rate possible. Vanbex should do the same with STOs. Why wait for the new company? Price the service in Fuel based on the original $1 token price goal. That act would undo the harm of the exaggerated claims of the and would avoid the costs and risks of moving to a new company.",False

Please find the following facts:  Vanbex is far from a shell company.  We are a legitimate consulting and development business in the cryptocurrency field – which is completely legal.  As opposed to what the media and the lawsuit has stated about us being a “shell company” or -scam, Vanbex has over 26 staff and a very substantial payroll to match. We were never aware of any RCMP or CRA investigation until we saw the notice of civil claim in late March. We never liquidated any assets to “avoid” any investigation.  All of our assets were purchased with funds that were lawfully ours to use. We have never misappropriated funds. No company funds were ever used for gambling purposes. None of our assets are the proceeds, or instruments of any unlawful activity. FUEL tokens are a necessary and important part of our business model and a real form of currency. The RCMP and the Canada Revenue Agency never contacted us or we would have immediately provided them with all the truthful information and documents. At no time was there any deceit or false representation to misappropriate funds from our customers or shareholders.   Please see attached our full response to the Civil Claim that was filed this afternoon.  We intend to defend vigorously and to present a complete and truthful narrative for the court.

If you missed the CryptoTaxes AMA. Make sure to check out all the questions from our community and answers from our CryptoTaxes lead developer Bevan. Thank you to everyone that participated in the AMA! 🙏    Q: How different is this compared to other tools out there, like https://www.cryptotrader.tax/ ?  A: Good question - there are lots of competitors in the US not so much in Canada and none are in Excel and none are primarily targeting Canada.    Q: Hello Bevan, it sounds good start but is there a plan to add more futures in order to provide more flexibility and outputs for the clients? I know couple of amazing products for the same purpose and they are really  solid so the competition would be tough to get a decent share of the market.  A: Well, our competitors are not in Excel and don’t provide the same features. Yes - we will always be improving the product.    Q: Can u give me a process on how to use the application?  A: Sure, you download the excel workbook, put in your transactions, set opening balances, upload the workbook, and then you get back the values you need in the workbook.    Q: What’s the price right now to use it?  A: The price is $499 CAD (but in FUEL) until April 30, 2019 - this price is for the current personal tax season.    Q: How will FUEL be used and what kind of companies are you targeting for the platform?  A: FUEL will be used to pay for the service and we are targeting accountants, crypto-traders, and crypto-businesses.    Q: Will it import transactions from exchanges via API key and from wallets by address?  A: Currently it works by manual input and also auto-conversion from Binance Excel file exports.    Q: How many tests have u gone through?  A: I think we tested with like 8-10 different users on the product design and features. We tested with all our 3 targeted groups and they all liked it - as it solves their problem of calculating their taxes in a way that is straight-forward and shows all the calculations in Excel formulas so that they have no magic and full visibility.   Q: Hey Bevan will CryptoTaxes be used eventually in the US? Market there is huge.  A: Eventually in the US for sure, in a few months.    Q: Why should people use CryptoTaxes? I usually like to avoid my taxes in crypto.  A: This is the first year in Canada that the CRA needs you to pay crypto taxes. Not paying taxes is tax evasion.    Q: Has anyone tested the platform yet?  A: I have tested it a lot internally and we have used it for a client to ship their taxes. I have tested all the different types of transactions and importing Binance and all the corner cases (errors, dups, and etc.)",False

After months of work and deliberation by the Vanbex and Etherparty team, the official rebrand has arrived. While things started as a focused branding initiative for Etherparty, it quickly evolved into an opportunity to fundamentally change for the better how our company was structured. We wanted to build a framework that will allow us to explore blockchain development and consultation across a wider range of products, and grow into a robust technology incubator.  To this end, Etherparty will now officially be called Vanbex Labs.  This name represents our commitment to being one of the premier blockchain technology companies in the industry. Not only will we continue to build and support our ICO and STO crowdsale platforms, but we will also be ambitiously exploring new projects for development with innovative smart contract products.  The FUEL Token is also a significant part of this new direction. FUEL will continue to power our products, but in a much more significant way in the future. FUEL will now act as an ecosystem wide utility token that will be used across multiple products and platforms, significantly increasing it’s reach. We have big plans for FUEL in 2019 that we can’t wait to share with you, so stay tuned.  However, none of this would be possible without our community. We are deeply humbled and grateful for the support over the years that allows us to build products and services that push the boundaries of blockchain technology.

Since then, as soon as the team delayed the launch of the roadmap (March), I appeared here. With each month of delays more and more, only empty promises. The roadmap is not executed, and the FUEL course falls. Do not talk about the bear market as a whole, because, as I said, many projects have not fallen from the price of ICO so much. Something is growing (where the team really works). Etherparty also only say that they ""working hard"", but these are empty words. There are basic signs of SCAM - 1) The team delays release 2) The team absolutely does not follow the promised roadmap 3) The team does not monitor the price of its shares 4) The team does shitposting, bad communication with investors.  I am not engaged in TROLLING, but only call on people to open their eyes. It is for this purpose that this thread exists. Besides me, there are only positive comments, like ""A wonderful project! The course will soon grow! WOW! BRILLNESS."" It is possible that these are fake comments, which are very easy to do. After all, people can not rejoice that their money disappears with each passing month more and more. And if the price falls from ICO -70%, it indicates the inefficiency of the company! They absolutely do not care about investors and obligations.  I want to stop people from making a mistake and not losing money. You can not trust Vanbex after this.

Since when has the delay and change in the roadmap become the norm?This has always been a bad sign of any organization and start-up. Shitposting is easy to see on Twitter. 95% are devoted to the blockchain and crypto-currencies in general, and not to the project of the Etherparty.If you call it ""Active"", then I have bad news for you.  If the organization believes that its company is undervalued, it may announce the repurchase of a part of the tokens. Etherparty did not do this. Everything that you wrote me, write in this forum for half a year already. And as you see, patience leads to multiple losses. I do not even need a profit, just return my money, which I originally invested. You can not even talk about Hero and Saturn. If the Rocket is delayed for such a long time, then these can not even be dreamed of.  They collected 33 million dollars. For what ? To take pictures of their dog in the office and travel the world?  And yes, if you started comparing prices, then look at the ICO price. On October 1, when the ICO Etherparty began, Bitcoin cost 4200 USD. Now it costs 8250$ ~ Etherium was $ 300 - now 470$, Bitcoin Cash was 400 ~ USD, now it's 840. But the price of Etherparty fell from 0.1 USD to 0.03$. IT IS A FACT!

How much did you lose money? 100 dollars? How many ? Because if you lost enough money, you would not say that. It's simple. You're a troll, not me. You do not need $ 33 million to do this kind of work. For this money, they could increase the workforce by 3 times, and make it faster if they wanted to. But they only make promises about HEAVY WORK ON THE PRODUCT. Every time the same thing. ""Focus on their product not their token price"" - I listen to this from early spring.

(PRWEB) APRIL 19, 2018[/size]  IdentityMind Global™, Digital Identities You Can Trust, announced that Etherparty Smart Contracts, Inc., a Vancouver, Canada blockchain technology company, has selected IdentityMind to provide KYC and AML compliance support for Etherparty’s Rocket crowdfunding platform.  Etherparty, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vanbex Group, builds intuitive, end-to-end smart contract solutions, the first of which is crowdfund creator Rocket. Rocket removes the complexity and management of creating and executing an ICO across multiple blockchains, which will include compatibility with Ethereum and Bitcoin’s blockchains at launch this spring.  The platform uses FUEL tokens so users can pay with all services across Etherparty’s suite of software products with the ERC-20 compatible digital token. Etherparty’s Rocket software product expects to support over 20 crowdsales on multiple blockchains this year.  IdentityMind provides a turnkey solution for customer onboarding, helping companies conduct know your customer (KYC) in an automated fashion, while meeting regulations worldwide. In addition, it provides anti-money laundering (AML) checks on potential ICO contributors.  “We’re excited to partner with IdentityMind, the leading KYC and AML solution white label provider for companies who support utility or security tokens,” said Kevin Hobbs, CEO, Vanbex Group. “Their KYC solution is the perfect complement to Etherparty’s end-to-end solution for crowdfunding. IdentityMind has everything we need – a proven, established product, domain expertise, extensive knowledge of the evolving global, regulatory and compliance environments, and proactive client services. Going forward, we have a more complete solution for our customers.”  “The partnership is a natural – IdentityMind and Etherparty provide clients looking to embark on an ICO with a turnkey solution,” said Garrett Gafke, CEO, IdentityMind Global. “Clients don’t have to search out and cobble together disparate solutions from multiple vendors as they map our their ICO journey. Working together, we can expedite the ICO process and provide a proven solution to ensure Vanbex customers meet KYC and AML compliance requirements worldwide.”  Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have grown exponentially with nearly $6 billion raised in 2017, and over $2 billion in Q1 of 2018. IdentityMind has worked with over 78 ICO clients in 20 countries across a variety of markets including lending, digital currency, retail, healthcare, payments, and more, evaluating more than 400,000 users, in nearly 80 countries who contributed over a billion dollars. Representative IdentityMind clients include Airtoken, BurstIQ, CRYPTO20, DataBroker DAO, Dragon Corporation, Fluz Fluz, Liquineq, Sparkle Coin, and others.  IdentityMind was recently named the recipient of two top industry awards: CIO Review’s 50 Most Promising FinTech Solution Providers and Disruptor Daily’s 10 RegTech Companies Making Waves in the Industry.",False

(“Etherparty”), a Vancouver blockchain technology company, is excited to announce the Rocket Three for Free contest, which will offer three projects or startup companies the opportunity to win full use of Etherparty’s cryptocurrency crowdfunding platform, Rocket, free of charge.  The anticipation surrounding the launch of Etherparty’s crowdfund creator has been steadily growing for months, and with the imminent arrival of Rocket, Etherparty has decided to hold a contest for startups looking to crowdfund using cryptocurrency. The smart contract solution developed by Etherparty called Rocket can be used on Bitcoin or Ethereum and is valued at USD $100,000.  Starting today, April 4, 2018, and running until April 30, 2018, applicants can submit a report, detailing their project, white paper and token purpose and functionality, along with company information including team LinkedIn profiles, social media channels, and Github, if public.  Once all of the applications have been submitted, short-listed companies will be interviewed by Etherparty’s leadership team, and the three winners will be announced in May. In addition, outside of the three winners, Etherparty will be selecting up to 100 projects that will be able to receive a discount to launch their crowdfund with Etherparty.  “The contest is an amazing chance for a few young companies to harness the latest in crowdfunding technology at no cost, and no risk,” said Kevin Hobbs, CEO at Etherparty.  Each winner will receive free token and crowdfund smart contracts, along with $20,000 worth in marketing services, to support their business and crowdfunding initiatives. The Rocket contest is looking to reward the best of the best, and Etherparty is excited to see what the community has to submit.  “We are looking for blockchain projects that are innovative and exciting, and we especially love projects that are problem-solving a large or global issue.”  Only one submission per startup is allowed, and each submission must contain all of the required information to be eligible. To learn more about the Three for Free contest, visit contest.etherparty.com/threeforfree.  For continued updates, visit etherparty.com and subscribe to the company mailing list.

GEN X the only ones that ever had to work hard.  They finally have found out that you can have the best product in the world and smartest contract in the world but none of it will matter if you do not market yourself. They need a spokesperson for this company because all 4 of these people are not it. Great product-Token will probably still hit .25 in next 30 days.

And I saw a few of your posts slamming the project with nonsense.  Are you just trying to manipulate the mood? Because that is what it looks like and everyone can see that.  LOL the team needs to dress up, haha that was the silliest thing I have ever heard. Thanks for the giggle.  So Kevin the one well dressed is the CEO, Lisa is head of R&D and the other two are lead developers. (When have you ever seen developers wearing suits?) No worries in the world, you say... For gosh sake they have answered every question that was asked by the community and to be honest it was one of the best AMAs, well recorded too, not the usual Hangout crap. And who is best to talk about the project in an AMA if not the people actually building the product? Shows how much you know. I even like the fact they have pets in the office, that is way cool!  As per marketing, not sure if you have been following them but they have ramped up things lately and they even mentioned they have 2 marketing firms onboard as well. What you seem to be looking at is the token price, possibly because you bought high and trying to get out. It shows so bad by the things you moan about.  I have been around since the presale, bought more in the public sale and have been hodling since, this team will do very well and I'm pretty confident I'll be singing of joy in a year from now.  My suggestion to you is to get out of EP and go buy some pump and dump token, and get yourself an SPQR (small profit, quick return). Oh and get yourself a pet or two, they may help with your grumpy mood. If you hold any FUEL you are not doing this community any favours, you just bring the mood down.

Blockchain startups working with the Vanbex Group have formally signed on to use the Etherparty platform in order to launch their token and crowdfund projects, as early as this spring, when Etherparty’s flagship product hits the market.  “Etherparty’s ability to complete the technology and security components on a company’s Token Generation Event in just a matter of minutes is a breakthrough in blockchain technology,” said Etherparty CEO, Kevin Hobbs.  “So instead of a process that can take months to complete under the current landscape, companies can now focus on building and marketing their blockchain project more effectively and efficiently without having to worry about the complexities around token and crowdfunding smart contract development.”  Etherparty is a blockchain product working to enable a connected and inclusive world by building easy-to-use, versatile and intuitive smart contract solutions. The crowdfunding application is just the first in a long line of blockchain-based solutions to be deployed by the Vancouver-based company.  FUEL is the token that powers the Etherparty platform. Users will pay for access to the platform’s functions, which includes access to a smart contract library, security monitoring tools, and a network monitoring dashboard.  The FUEL token, which is a transferable ERC-20 compliant digital token deployed on the Ethereum network, will serve as a method of validating a user’s transactions on the Etherparty platform and its related products.  For more information, visit etherparty.com and subscribe to the company mailing list. You can also join the Etherparty conversation via our community Telegram channel, or on Facebook, Twitter and BitcoinTalk. https://blog.etherparty.com/news-release-etherparty-secures-top-blockchain-startups-to-launch-icos-via-new-crypto-crowdfund-b7462ea85a7a",False

But again people have been buying these up and I would have to recalculate those numbers, but if I were to guess I'd say about $100,000 standing in the way now.  The coin isn't properly listed on HitBTC, if you try to make a deposit or a withdraw you can't as it's listed as an ""IOU token"". I've opened a support ticket with them asking when they will properly list it, but I don't expect to get an answer back anytime soon. Someone told me it takes a few months to get a response from them. Maybe if we flooded their twitter page it could help? In the meantime, etherdelta is the only exchange, that I know of, that you can buy/sell FUEL.   As far as people selling at a loss, people panic. Most of the people who did panic have already sold it seems and $100,000 to reach ICO price is a drop in the bucket.  Also, if you notice, there are sell/buy orders going through that are much lower than the top buy price. For example the current top bidder is buying at 0.000128740 FUEL/ETH but you'll see a sell order go through for someone selling at something like .00008. These are just people selling to their own orders so they can take the listing down. Due to how the exchange operates, your offer will continue to stay listed until it either expires, or is fulfilled. So to get their money back rather than have it wait in limbo until expiration, people are just buying/selling to their own orders.",False

So consider it like ""smart contracts for the masses"" with pre-made contract templates that can easily be customized and run. It removes the complexity of creating, managing and executing smart contracts on any blockchain. The platform allows users to create an enforceable, self-executing digital agreement for all types of transactions.  Etherparty will initially work on Ethereum but we are aiming at being blockchain agnostic. Through Rootstock (RSK) we will be able to run smart contracts on Bitcoin too. In the future we are also looking to integrate with any other blockchain that becomes popular and we are open to collaborations.  FUEL, the token, is needed to perform any action on Etherparty, it's the only mean of payment to create a smart contract on the platform. It pays for the ETH or Bitcoin tx fees, covers for the cost of the contract and any other cost associated with the platform. One token does it all basically. Much easier for customers too who instead of having to manage multiple tokens for multiple blockchains will only require the one.  We cannot speculate on monetary value however we aim for the platform to become really popular with all sorts of smart contracts available. Users can create peer-to-peer escrow contracts, wagering, token creation, crowdfunding, supply chain management, real estate agreements, contractor agreements and more. Some of the contracts will cost more than others (in the thousands of FUEL) so there will be demand from Etherparty customers generating network effect. Our target markets are consumer as well as business and corporate. We believe many businesses out there will benefit from the ability to use smart contracts for their activities cutting down on overhead costs.

'This will be a one most transformative blockchain applications released to date' stated Kevin Hobbs, CEO at Vanbex, the developers behind the Etherparty platform.  'We are continually educating people on the adaptation of blockchain technologies and Etherparty is pivotal to that,' stated Hobbs. 'Etherparty allows the general public who are unfamiliar with coding and programming to be able to benefit from blockchain and smart contract technologies when applying them to their daily activities or operations.'  Etherparty was unveiled at the Crypto Financing conference in London on July 7 and then presented at Coinscrum Meetup.  'This is a fully functional blockchain product that has real-world applications. It is also the opportune time to launch the Etherparty application as governments worldwide have recently boosted talks to embrace blockchain technologies and exchanges like the CBOE, seek to list their own cryptocurrencies.' stated Hobbs, who recently demonstrated the Etherparty platform to multiple audiences.  'Whether you are an employer creating contracts, a business that uses supply chain management, or a project in the cryptocurrency space looking to do an ICO, it can all be done on Etherparty, in minutes, in the most secure, efficient and cost-effective way to date', according to Etherparty Architect Brian Onn.  Funds raised will help grow the Etherparty development team who plan to release a version of the platform to market by end of year. A beta version has already launched and Etherparty is currently accepting up to 500 testers.  'We have been able to prove that real world information is able to interact with Smart Contracts, and now we are launching an ICO to further our development and research in making Smart Contracts easy to use and accessible,' stated Founder, Lisa Cheng.  The Etherparty coin offering will offer a secure way to accept funds during the pre-sale phase using a process that will be handled via a SAFT, or Simple Agreement for Future Tokens.  'From a technology viewpoint, the Etherparty Platform is a whole new paradigm in smart contract development and deployment. With numerous security audited Solidity contracts at the platform user's disposal,' said Onn.  About Etherparty  Etherparty is a contract wizard that removes the complexity of creating, managing and executing smart contracts on any blockchain. The platform allows users with zero knowledge of smart contract programming to create an enforceable, self-executing digital agreement for all types of transactions.   PRESALE IS NOW ON!

Sign up here: https://demo.etherparty.com  JOIN OUR TELEGRAM GROUP OR REGISTER FOR EMAIL UPDATES     ABOUT  Etherparty is a platform that removes the complexity and management of creating and executing smart contracts. Etherparty is an easy-to-use smart contract creator that allow users to compile and deploy smart contracts with zero programming or smart contract syntax knowledge.   WHY ETHERPARTY?  No Other Tools or Software Required - Using Etherparty means that you won't need to install anything else like Geth, Meteor, or Mist to run smart contracts. Custom Templates, No Code Required - Your contract drafts are always available and ready to execute without the need to code. Log in from wherever you are and deploy. No Sync Required - Etherparty works directly with the Ethereum network so there’s no delay for software to sync to quickly execute a contract. Infinitely Scalable - Etherparty's framework allows for infinite scalability to match the needs of the Smart Contract as necessary. Process Automation - Deploying Smart Contracts rely on a back end of packages, modules, and libraries. Etherparty automates this process to just a few clicks of a button. Always On - The Etherparty cloud enables you to login from anywhere in the world and seamlessly pull up your Smart Contract drafts. Click to Deploy - Execute Smart Contracts in less time without the hassle and complexity of setting up and maintaining the network requirements.         ETHERPARTY PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC)   The current website architecture is derived from a proof-of-concept (PoC) application and is designed to show common features such as sign-on, selection of a contract, the challenging of another user, acceptance of the contract for each user, and deployment of the contract. This is done using the platform user interface and through the use of “FUEL”, the platform token for transactions. FUEL tokens will be used to pay for the creation of smart contracts on the platform.   Etherparty allows a user to write a smart contract or choose a contract template through a system of drop-down menus. Etherparty is based on distributed website architecture with secure sign-on, contract selection, engagement of other users, acceptance of the contract for each user and deployment of the contract. The current application includes a wagering contract for professional baseball that should be considered as a simple look-and-feel demonstration.   Interaction with the platform is achieved through the user interface. Etherparty will charge fees in fuel so that users only have to use one token to operate and run applications.  The application is structured as a tiered subscription service that starts off free for users to access and execute one-to-two contracts per month. The second tier will be set with a higher contract limit, while the third tier will increase upon the previous tier, with even higher limits and the enterprise API will allow businesses to keep their existing contracts and processes but turn them into smart contracts or executable decentralized contracts on the blockchain of their choice. First integration is Ethereum, next is Bitcoin.  ETHERPARTY HAS RELEASED A BETA FOR THE COMMUNITY TO TEST AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK.  CHECK IT OUT HERE.   Check out our walkthrough videos for 2 of the smart contracts available on our Beta.  Etherparty Beta: Escrow Contract Walkthrough  https://youtu.be/3wn9t7dzxqQ    Etherparty Beta: Token + Crowdfunding Contract Walkthrough  https://youtu.be/PL9KKcAZJwE    USE CASES   Etherparty opens the blockchain to the world. The platform is applicable for the writing and deployment of a range of smart contract solutions across a variety of industries and situations, including banking, trade finance, healthcare, supply chain management, insurance, foreign exchange trading, real estate, digital identity, and more.  Smart contracts offer substantial benefits by automating contractual agreements, which reduce transactional friction, cuts costs and boosts data security. Any type of contract can be made better by using smart contract technology.   Financial Services  Milestone-based payments  Problem: Handled by traditional means, the process of managing a payment process with another party can lead to discrepancies, error and confusion. Whether a personal agreement or a business contract with payout based on defined parameters, there is room for mistakes, disagreement and lost paperwork which can amount to trouble.  Solution: A smart contract agreement can automate the payment process between parties, distributing funds and notifications automatically, once it’s been determined terms have been met.   Manufacturing   Supply chain management Trade finance  Problem: Tracking goods and information, especially across international lines, can be a hassle and a lengthy process given current workflow approval processes and the reliance, still, on paper-based systems.     Solution: With Etherparty’s Enterprise package, integrating any information system into the platform is simple and streamlined. Write a smart contract to bring all parties onto a single, shared ledger and reap the benefits of speed, security and transparency of digital ledger technology.      Cross-Industry   Peer to Peer Transactions Contractor agreements Contracts with executable conditions (e.g. Smart probate or smart wills) Record Keeping    Problem: From a simple wager between two individuals to maintaining a record of data, the Internet has turned physical interactions digital. The core value of trust remains.   Solution: Smart contracts and blockchain technology can alleviate concern over a breach of contract or the veracity of a digital record. By establishing appropriate terms, Etherparty makes it easy and helps guide users through, a contract will auto-enforce any agreements settled as outlined by each party. Further, a smart contract can hash a record to the blockchain, which removes any degree of ambiguity over the digital upload.   Legal   Forming a Business Corporate Filing  Problem: A lot of paperwork to manage and keep track of, uncertainty over whether something has been filed or modified.  Solution: Business formation and corporate filings stored in a shared ledger, immutable, offers the most rigid and secure method to set your business up. Not to mention a significant reduction in cost and time cutting out the intermediaries.   ICO Creation  ROI Budget Speed of execution and go to market  Problem: Finding reliable smart contract developers, delivery time-frame, cost of Token and Sale Contracts development, testing...  Solution: With Etherparty you can create an entire ICO campaign in minutes not months and at a fraction of the cost. Create your token, create the crowdfunding contract, create your escrow, create your ICO page and then you are ready to launch.  And Many More...   Types of contracts  The full list of system-wide contracts that Etherparty will make available initially is still to be determined. For a start, here is a list of potential contracts:  Voting contracts, Ballot Box Notary Service 2-person escrow contracts Family Trust Money Manager Corporate Stock Crowdfunding Timesharing Timelocked Vault M of N (multisignature) escrow M of N (multisignature) vault Real-Estate Sales Supply-Chain Management needs DAO & DAC’s Customizable user created contracts   THE TOKEN (FUEL)   FUEL Tokens are the key to using Etherparty, they manage the contract library, security testing, network fees, monitoring, and management of the entire smart contract process. FUEL is a transferable ERC-20 compliant digital token deployed on the Ethereum network, and is the in-app currency that powers the Etherparty platform. The FUEL token serves as a method of validating the user’s interactions with Etherparty and will allow users to buy, execute, or barter for other smart contracts on the platform.  In the future, FUEL will serve as access for smart contracts on multiple blockchains, integrating these disparate blockchains into one unified view within the Etherparty platform.  The total supply will be one billion FUEL tokens and will never be increased beyond this cap. The smallest unit of FUEL is one wei. Tokens that are used on the platform will go back into the platform supply. We will provide a service for users to purchase FUEL from this supply.  Allocation  Only one billion FUEL tokens will ever be created. The FUEL tokens are intended to be allocated as follows:  40% (400,000,000) to be sold by the Company to pre-sale purchasers pursuant to a SAFT offering or through Company Approved Affiliates. If all pre sale tokens get sold at the highest bonus 35% then there will be a total of 540,000,000 million FUEL tokens sold. 40% (400,000,000) to be sold by the Company to Crowdsale purchasers. If the pre-sale sells out in full at the highest bonus level 35% there would only be 260,000,000 tokens available in the public sale. 10% (100,000,000) reserved by the Company to incentivize community, beta testers, and strategic partners. 5% (50,000,000) to be sold directly on the platform. 5% (50,000,000) to be distributed by the Company to the Etherparty team.  Etherparty platform and Company staff tokens will be locked for 6 months after the end of the token sale. Any unsold tokens in the pre-sale will go into the public sale. All unsold tokens from the public sale will stay on the Etherparty platform held by the Company for sale only on the platform.    ETHERPARTY ROADMAP   User Created Templates Create your own custom contract templates with a guided Contract Wizard to help you along. You can save these templates to your application account, and later recall these contract templates for testing and deployment on the blockchain.  Drag and Drop Contract Builder A sophisticated user interface that uses drag and drop from a side panel toolbar to a contract workspace, allowing the user to visually construct custom contracts. The user will have the ability to choose from a variety of data-sources, data-sinks, data-oracles, data-transformations, contract-clauses, platform-users (from a user’s contacts list), etc. Contracts can be saved and later edited in this form, and recalled for testing and deployment. A visual flowchart of data into and out of the contract as well as transformations of the contract data will be displayed and can be manipulated via the Contract Builder interface.  Teams and Team Features With team features, you will be able to add members to your team, share and annotate contracts,  Shared Contract Templates Creating contracts can take a little time, so you will surely want to amortize your time spent by saving and sharing your contracts with others, in your group or team. Through your own personal library and team library, you will be able to share your created contracts with other users of your team.  Enterprise Integration Through the Etherparty REST API our enterprise customers can add users to their team, create contract templates, test contracts on our test networks, submit contracts to the main blockchain, and get results of those contracts. The API will allow integration into existing enterprise workflows at any stage. Any existing enterprise application can be integrated into our smart contract workflow platform with ease.  Enterprise Solution By using the Etherparty Advanced User Interface on our platform, Enterprise Solution customers will be able to create and manage teams of users, and create contract templates, share those templates among team members and deploy contracts to the main blockchain network for execution. Enterprise Solution users can test and deploy contracts, and save contracts into their Enterprise account on the Etherparty platform. Enterprise Solution is a hosted solution for enterprise customers, offering all the functionality of our standard platform plus additional features that are necessary for enterprise customers.  Mobile App A better experience on mobile with push notifications and integration with Google Voice on Android.  Google Voice Assistant Integrated assistance via voice commands on mobile. With Google Voice Assistant, you can say “Hey, Google, create an Etherparty escrow contract for $500 between myself and Mr. Smith, which expires on next Tuesday”. The mobile application with integrated Google Voice Assistant will create the contract on the Etherparty platform and make it ready for execution. Further voice commands can be used to execute the contract, with Google Voice presenting confirmation requests as needed.  Convolutional Neural Net for AI (CNN AI) Smarter contracts will be even smarter with the assistance of our state of the art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Contract Assistant. It’s like having your own personal advisor by your side 24/7. Build on the knowledge and experience of other users’ contracts within the Etherparty Platform as our machine learning algorithms (ML) learn from and can suggest contract requirements to you while building your own Etherparty contracts.    Natural Language Processor With the help of our natural language processor (NLP) you will be able to enter your contract requirements in plain English. Complemented with the guidance of our CNN AI you will be able to quickly create the complex contracts that you need and deploy them to the blockchain.
