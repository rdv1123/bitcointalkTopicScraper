Airdrop functionality is ready and it looks very promising. Why do we believe in it? - Almost every project needs airdrop service for token distribution  - There are no ready solutions on the market except of MyWish  - Our service helps to save up to 30% of gas cost  - User has full control of the tokens — no need to send it to a 3rd party service  - it’s very simple for everyone — bounty managers, community assistants, developers.  Please welcome: Airdrop contract. Contract price: 2 ETH.  2. EOS integration is in progress. We have completed event scanner development: https://github.com/MyWishPlatform/event_scanner/tree/feature/eos-scanner  3. Investment Pool contract development is started. We got a lot of requests for it during the conferences.\  Exchanges.  During the last week we had talks with Huobi Pro and one top-10 exchange. Listing is requiring a lot of procedures and documents filling.  In addition, during the next couple of weeks we will integrate our token with BestRate.org . Everyone will be able to buy/sell WISH without exchanges & registration.

These are AURORA, CREDITS, NEM; - Associations like Hyper Ledger https://www.generalbytes.com/ would love to welcome MyWish as their member; - MyWish has attracted a lot of attention of ICO agencies: we received several suggestions for partnerships regarding the creation of smart contracts for their clients; they asked us about the opportunity for API; - The MyWish Team held 4 presentations; - more than 500 people/companies visited our stands and had a personal conversation with the MyWish Team; among them there were people with personal interest and with business purposes such as IBM, EY, Intel etc; - more than 10 companies have decided to create their ICO with MyWish contracts; - we have met the representatives of various exchanges such as Huobi and discussed the conditions of listing there.

Here is our weekly report.  https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/35522833_178059462867453_1100399706753728512_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=568898f39a42e3d136d2a0557b9f61e5&oe=5BAC1B36  Development  We were recognized by The Merkle as project “that stand out as ones which meet their deadlines”: https://nulltx.com/four-cryptocurrency-projects-that-hit-deadlines/ MyWish will continue to meet the deadlines.  1. We are proud to announce that the NEO Crowdsale contract is ready. We have implemented many functions that make the Crowdsale process convenient for projects & investors:      The Crowdsale contract is compatible with the NEP-5 standard token, and has the following functions: - Purchase of tokens by using the function mintTokens.  - Limited time for ICO.  - A limited maximum number of tokens that can be sold (hard cap).  - The ability to transfer ownership of the contract to another address.  - Only the owner is authorized to withdraw money from the contract.  - The possibility to add tokens to several addresses before ICO starts.  - Notifications of any errors before returning imprecise.  - Extension of NEP5 with allowance, approve, transferFrom functions.  https://github.com/MyWishPlatform/neo-ico-contracts/blob/develop/Crowdsale.Contract/Crowdsale.template.cs  We have also made a template for a separate contract token that is compatible with NEP-5: - Extension of NEP5 with allowance, approve, transferFrom functions  - Issuing tokens by the mint function.  -Transfer of ownership of the contract.  2. We have rolled-out the ability to change the dates of Crowdsale contracts after they have been deployed. This feature was requested by many projects that have or intend to use the MyWish platform.  3. Chinese localization is almost done, and is planned to be released by the end of the week. Our team has predicted that more people from China will begin utilizing our platform once this is fully deployed.  4. Whitelist adding to the Crowdsale contract is projected to be released on the 29th of June.  5. We are excited to announce the date for the Airdrop contract release. The 6th of July is the prospective date.  6. EOS/Cardano plans for integration have been confirmed.  Take a look at the latest version here: https://contracts.mywish.io  Exchanges  Due to the increase in daily trading volume, our token has become increasingly more attractive for alternative exchanges. Our team is still working on future listings to KuCoin, Bitfinex, and Binance.  Marketing  - In recent times media coverage about MyWish has excelled. The following articles have been published: TheMerkle: https://nulltx.com/four-cryptocurrency-projects-that-hit-deadlines/ Crypto Briefing: https://cryptobriefing.com/all-dogecoins-go-to-heaven-crypto-after-you-kick-it/ (the coverage is above 562,000) Insider.pro: https://ru.insider.pro/analytics/2018-06-10/kak-peredat-bitkoin-po-nasledstvu/ (the coverage is above 960,000) Other media channels have had a smaller coverage. John McAfee mentioned our project on his Twitter. https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1002350965947805696  - We have began negotiations with Lindsay Dee Lohan’s personal relations manager. He is interested in the fascinating way of facilitating personal relations for her through crypto and smart contract topics. - We have tried to make contact with representatives of several blockchains. We have received responses from Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum Zero, sent them personal offers, and are now currently waiting for consultation. - We have announced the intermediate results of the competition in the frame of the Ambassador Program. We have chosen several candidates from different countries. Now we are developing personal offers for them.

Here is our weekly update.  Development After the NEO token builder release, many users tried to created NEP-5 tokens on our platform. However, token contracts are not enough for the crowdsale process. This is a key process for the entire blockchain industry, and that is why we are continuing our development. On the 18th of June, we have planned to launch our Crowdsale contract with NEO’s blockchain. We would like to thank NEO for their continuous support. As we continue to develop the NEO Crowdsale contract, we are planning on launching the following additional features: - Ability to change the dates of Crowdsale contracts after they have been deployed. This feature was requested by many users, and is planned on being released on the 18th of June. - On the 7th of June we are launching our Japanese localization with the intention of adding Chinese next. - EOS integration is on-going and will come to our platform without a doubt in the near future. - Cardano (ADA) integration is currently being discussed with Cardano team. - Airdrop/Whitelist contracts are planned, but no release dates yet.  Take a look at the latest version here: https://contracts.mywish.io  Exchanges  We have been getting a lot of offers from small exchanges, but they are lower in daily volume than IDEX or Cryptopia. Therefore, we are continuing negotiations with big players such as KuCoin, Bitfinex, and Binance.  Marketing  - The recent integration between NEO & MyWish was included in the list of major crypto news as of May 30: https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@hardlydifficult/crypto-news-may-30-2018-red-day - Alexandr and Valeriy will be attending the Blockchain Community Summit in Moscow on the 23rd of June. While attending the event they will be discussing the different opportunities of blockchain technology, and the potential of smart contracts for personal/business utilization. - The next conference we plan to visit is the Blockchain Summit in London on the 26th and 27th of June. While there, Valeriy will speak about blockchains, smart contracts, and how to use both in personal/business aims. The MyWish team will be presenting in the exhibition area with a stand, and will be encouraging guests to get involved in the process of Smart Contract creation. - On the 27th of June, Vladimir will be discussing the same topic that Valeriy did in London at the Blockchain Expo in Amsterdam. As with our previous Summit attendances, there will be a stand present and we would like to meet as many people as possible while there. - We have written and translated press release into Chinese, which discusses the integration of MyWish & NEO. Now, we are sending out this press release to Chinese crypto media sources. - We are also searching for bloggers who discuss smart contracts on a fluent and proficient level. We plan to try using this marketing channel to provide MyWish with a higher level of recognition. - We have concluded the application process for the Ambassador Program for MyWish. Our team would like to say a formal thank you to all of the participants for their interest and initiative. We received a lot of applications, and are proud of the interest of the candidates. We will be taking some time to carefully examine the answers of each candidate before we announce the results. The anticipated date for the announcement of the results is the 13th of June.

However, we will change our priorities in the next week if not get final commitments. We understand the importance of the listing on big exchanges and small exchanges are out of our interests.  Marketing  * We have launched a campaign with promo codes that allow each of you to earn. More details about it are here: https://medium.com/@VladimirTikhomirov/promo-campaign-b2353949d9c * As the result of the advertising campaign, the number of followers on Facebook has increased from 997 to 5.449. It can not be denied that for the new visitors an activity and an involvement on the page in social networks are important indicators. Their high level allows inspiring confidence in new people. * We have updated main site: Team, Roadmap and News section. * During marketing research, we have found that market size in Russia deserves more attention on our part ($310 MLN was raised by Russian projects in 2017). Thus, we provide the Russian users with the possibility to learn about MyWish in their own language. Our aim is to make MyWish the most convenient for each user. Chinese will be the next language to support. * We plan to place feedback from MyWish users on the landing page. What is more, their reviews will be with “active” links in order the visitors could get the honest opinion from different users of our platform. * On March 22, the international conference “Blockchain and Bitcoin” was held in Tallinn. This is one of a series of similar conferences in Europe, Israel, the CIS. There were many participants from Europe, as well as representatives of the United States and South-East Asia. The conference was attended by companies that are going to do token sale. MyWish expertise in creating smart contracts, the existence of different wizards, a special wizard for Crowdsale have aroused interest. European and American participants were separately interested in where MyWish takes developers and what is the experience of educating people. We got many interesting contacts that must grow into contracts.  Among new projects which used MyWish for Crowdsale, we would like to mention PharmaToken (https://pharmatoken.io/). Now everyone can pay for drugs by PharmaToken.  We would like to thank the Community for the continuous support.

This feature ensures that MyWish users don't risk losing their tokens when funds are accidentally sent to a contract address which doesn't support ethereum tokens.   The MyWish platform deploys your smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain from a specific address. Because of this, the private key has to be available on the web server for signing and deployment. This web server has many other services running, which leads to an increase in the attack surface. How does MyWish make it safe?  Aleksei Udalov (our Senior Backend Developer) proposed the following solution; move the private key to a separate server with only one function: signing the transactions.  Aleksei is now focused on this task.   One of CTO's (Valeriy Dubrava) tasks is the integration of the RSK technology.

Now, MyWish token sale started: https://mywish.io/. Join the telegram group for more information: https://t.me/MyWish_platform  Future will surely surprise us, but we can already predict some changes.  It is obvious why cryptocurrency and smart contracts itself have a lot of scepticism around. It could be explained as something new and unlike things that we got used to. That’s the situation that we are trying to solve here. Furthermore, it triggers changes, because some professions will be not required.  Anyway, smart contracts are gaining their popularity for being easy to sign contract for both sides, it’s easy to settle accounts according to them and undeniable for execution.    It goes to show that some powerful nowadays professions would be simply unnecessary. Lets look through it deeply. The lawyer — one of the “always-in-demand” experts, mediators, and who always helps people draft contracts — will be replaced by code. Simple, impossible to break and available for everyone who can code. No possibility of interruption, no misunderstandings in contest, no unfair judges. Cool? Yes. Such a contracts are already coded and signed at MyWish. Good example would be wedding contract — your finances are combined, so you are having and conducting family budget together without dealing with lawyer. The same with last will, deals, insurance or any other coded contracts. There are still some risks, for example, there might be a mistake in a code, and it could cause stealing money as it happened with well known The DAO. That’s why every contract must come through multi-level checks, and that’s what is obligatory to every contract on the platform.  In addition, all the business information and transactions will be stored in blockchain, so that is the time, we are saying goodbye to a life-long lines in banks, for example. No one would refuse such a possibility.  It all might sound sad in some case — but as much as crypto world takes from us, much more it gives. New professions, which we couldn’t even imagine 20 years before, come to the reality. Our life rapidly goes online and requires new knowledges and new specializations. Virtual reality designer, online lawyer, smart contract developer and much more — these are the experts who will be highly required in ten years.  So it is time for young generation to understand the coming changes and be the one to catch the new wave.  MyWish token sale started: https://mywish.io/.

Now, MyWish token sale started: https://mywish.io/. Join the telegram group for more information: https://t.me/MyWish_platform  The MyWish platform was created with the goal of implantation high technologies into real life. The introduction of smart contracts allowed creating the necessary services for crypto-owners, but understanding of its application and convenience did not appear immediately. For lots of people, the creation of a smart contract still seems to be a very complex technological process, which is only available to the dedicated ones. We wanted to dispel this myth and make smart contracts accessible to anyone who does not have special knowledges.  We made the interface of the MyWish platform very simple to popularize the idea of applying smart contracts, because with its help it is possible to solve a huge number of issues in the digital economy. Smart contracts can replace a number of institutions that regulate the circulation of money in the fiat world.    The statistics of signed in users on MyWish and the number of concluded smart contracts since the launch of the platform demonstrate that we are moving in the right direction. We observe that smart contracts are in demand, and people are ready to apply them.  We have 537 signed up users and 205 concluded contracts on the platform within 2 months after the launch of MyWish.    The most popular is Will contract, which allows you to transfer funds to the backup wallet in case of a long absence of the owner. There are 133 such contracts.  Contract Lost key (transfer of funds to the backup wallet in case of key loss)  and Deferred payment (transfer of funds to the wallet of another owner after passing a certain period) concluded 12 people for each contact.  One pair concluded a Wedding contract.  Read about it in cointelegraph: https://cointelegraph.com/news/four-weddings-and-a-funeral-blockchain-style  In addition, apart from the contracts for individuals we are working to create contracts in the B2B sector. Our trial contract for a pizzeria for one day found a response among 47 owners of the ether.      http://delivery.mywish.io/  We plan to invest heavily in the direction of smart contracts for business, as we see the prospects for growth. In addition, the Insurance contract is expected to be launched soon, which will open up new opportunities in the sphere of insurance.  Now, MyWish token sale started: https://mywish.io/.

The way crypto works is still that funds are owned by individuals, or even in the event of this, multi-sig requiring consent of both. What if one party simply refuses to cooperate and co-sign?

Now, MyWish token sale started: https://mywish.io/. Join the telegram group for more information: https://t.me/MyWish_platform  This is full version of the article, brief version can be found on cointelegraph: https://cointelegraph.com/news/four-weddings-and-a-funeral-blockchain-style  The popularity of the blockchain grows together with the spheres of its application. Technical features of the system allow its adherents to invent new services and platforms for implementing the most non-standard ideas. Now it is time when everyone can create something that did not exist earlier and could become a pioneer in any business.  This opportunity attracted a young couple from St. Petersburg — Vasily Lifanovsky and Alla Tkachenko. Young people decided to combine their crypto-savings into a single family budget and fix it in the form of the first marriage contract in Russia concluded in the system of blockchains. This action became possible with the help of the MyWish platform which helps users to manage crypto-currency assets in various life situations including marriage.    The genuine idea to combine their crypto-wallets with a smart-contract was Vasily’s. The guy was interested in the sphere of blockchain since he had graduated from the university in 2013. Now he is creating smart-contracts in the DDG company. He was the first who decided to use the new service. The couple met at work. Problems with the adoption of a mutual decision did not arise because the topic of innovative technologies was close to both. With the great pleasure, Alla supported the groom’s initiative to become the first couple in the country that concluded a marriage agreement on joint management of the crypto currency.  “When I first heard about the blockchains, I considered that a certain network had been created over the existing economic institutions. And this network could be influenced by ourselves. Each participant of this network, whether it is an ordinary guy or a girl with a computer, can directly manage it. The system inspired me so much that I decided to become a part of the near future and also to make influence on it. Now, when I have a family, I want to make sure that our finances are protected from various circumstances. Although I believe that the fiat money will depreciate in five years, it is logical to resolve the issue of a joint crypto-budget right now. The time when the money was stored in glass jars has gone forever. “- explains his decision Vasily.    The couple held the conclusion of the wedding contract in the picturesque hall of the Rumyantsev mansion in the circle of the closest people. According to the couple, they wanted this event to be immortalized not only in the blockchain system, but also in the family archive.  The essence of the marriage contract is that the couple’s savings will be combined by a smart contract created on the MyWish platform, where they can transfer funds in the future. Additionally, money from third-party wallets can enter there. For example, Vasil and Alla offer their friends and relatives under this contract to give them wedding gifts in the form of crypto currency.  The newlyweds will be able to use the funds only with consent of both. This creates the possibility of mutual regulation of financial issues in the family. They can set various conditions, such as the possibility of withdrawing savings only after 5 years marriage. Thus, the marriage contract will allow its owners to accumulate a certain amount for a stated goal.  In case of termination of the contract, all funds that are received from the wallets of the couple will be returned inversely in proportion to the amount they are received. And the funds from other wallets will be divided in half. There are 3 months given to cancel the termination in case of an unwise decision. In the event of the death of one of the couple, the funds will be transferred to the account of the heir or the spouse.    The MyWish platform provides you with the infrastructure for solutions that save the owners crypto-currency using a secure smart-contract. There is a big amount of developed contracts for different life circumstances: the loss of a private key, the transfer of money for a particular case — wills, gifts and marriage contracts. The developers are trying to bring the blockchain closer to real life and make it accessible and understandable for everyone  MyWish token sale started: https://mywish.io/.

We see a perspective in application of smart contracts for the conclusion of labor contracts and payment of salaries in cryptocurrency. Smart contracts will increase the employee’s guarantees in comparison with the usual employment contract.  In particular, the labor contract on a smart contract will allow:  - Transfer wages in cryptocurrency (at the request of the employee); - Ensure that the employer fulfills all arrangements, since the change of the contract is impossible without the consent of the employee; - Guarantee the transfer of wages in full and in pre-agreed amount, exactly in the period specified in the contract without a single delay.  Under the conditions prescribed in smart contract, the employer will not be able to evade fulfillment of its obligations. This will protect the employee from the company’s dishonest attitude.    The MyWish platform took the initiative to become a technical consultant on this issue at the state level and develop a universal kind of smart contract that will meet all the requirements of labor legislation. We sent a letter to the Labor Department with a proposal to develop a prototype of the claimed contract, which can be used as soon as the cryptocurrency is legalized.

Moreover, the crypto-owners are not an exception. People who believe in the growth and popularization of the digital economy are already thinking about how to save savings for descendants. Until recently the issue of transferring the cryptocurrency to relatives was opened. The developers of the MyWish platform created the solution. Platform specializes in managing cryptocurrency assets in various life situations and it based on smart contracts. Deferred payment is one of the contracts created on the platform. It allows you to transfer funds to another owner’s wallet after passing a certain period.    Murat Arpaci from Ankara became the first person to take advantage of the new service. Murat created a smart contract under the terms of which his twelve-year-old son Arda Ege will have access to a wallet with donated ethers on the day of majority. Within 6 years, the gift will be stored in the system and wait for its time. Murat made a blog entry where explains why he decided to make such an unusual gift to his son: “It seemed to me that this is a very cool idea, since I believe that the cryptocurrency will grow. I hope that the amount of money will be at the time of my son’s full age. I care about the future of my family.”  There is a high chance that the service will become very popular among crypto-parents, as it allows transferring savings to the children of any age and at any time. In consequence of a simple interface, each person can make a smart contract without much knowledge in IT. Most importantly that the terms of the contract will be fulfilled regardless of external circumstances and life situations that can happen in a few years. The heir is guaranteed to receive its own cryptocurrency.  MyWish token sale started: https://mywish.io/. Join the telegram group for more information: https://t.me/MyWish_EN",False

Now, MyWish is preparing for the ICO, which will start on October, 25. Official site: https://mywish.io/. Join the telegram group for more information: https://t.me/MyWish_EN  Due to the growth of a bitcoin, the issue of safety of wallets is gaining popularity. As you know, you can’t extract the crypto-currency from a wallet without a password because a 256-bit private key is almost impossible to crack. Lost bitcoins will be lost forever. The total number of bitcoins in the world is limited. They are limited to 21 million. About 17 million have already been mined, but almost 30% of them are “dead weight” — the currency that will never be used in the future. At the moment, the total number of “dead” bitcoins is about 4.3 million, and their cost is about $14 billion at today’s price. Key are lost constantly. Let’s look at the top most popular ways to lose your savings in the crypto-currency.  1. Throwing out a USB flash drive or hard drive. One of the most common and annoying mistakes, which are made by the owners of wallets, is to lose intentionally or accidentally the carrier on which this wallet was kept on. The most famous cases appeared at the early stage of existence of digital currency, when bitcoin did not have a significant value. James Howells, a 28-year-old IT specialist from Newport, is notorious in the crypto-world as a man who got rid of 7,500 BTC voluntarily. James was one of the first miners in the world, but then he abandoned his hobby because of the underestimation of the prospects of the crypto-currency. For three years he kept a hard disk with a wallet till a general cleaning, which he did in 2013. Attempts to dig a disk in a rubbish dump did not succeed. David Kitchen, who is also a Briton, was just blear-sighted. He stopped mining due to the noise of the fan, and his 50 bitcoins, which were on the USB drive, were simply erased and replaced by a Linux distribution. At present, hardly anyone will throw out a flash drive with bitcoins consciously, but no one is insured against the mechanical damage or accidental loss of a removable media.  2. Losing access to the password. Owners of crypto-wallets are most afraid of password theft, so they are insured against it in every way, using most reliable methods. For example, Adam Leonard, who is a CEO of the BlockEx stock exchange, stored a number and password from a wallet with 6000 BTC on Hushmail (a secure email service). The service has established itself as a reliable one, but has let its user down. Adam lost the password for mail itself, and it was impossible to restore it. Today, Hushmail locked the amount of $ 28,780,000, which no one will ever be able to use. Even the most reliable way of storing passwords can let people down and force them to abandon a fortune.  3. Losing a piece of paper with a password. You can protect yourself from the unreliability of storing keys on digital media and services in an old-fashioned way — to write a password on paper. At first sight, it’s a simple and effective tool that won’t be cracked surely. But a paper carrier is even easier to lose than a digital password. Vladimir Tikhomirov, the founder of the IT company DDG, purchased bitcoins for 500 000 rubles in 2015. He left the piece paper with a printed password in a table drawer. When the bitcoin price reached $ 1000, the company moved to a new office and changed furniture. The password was irretrievably lost because of the change of furniture. Obviously, Vladimir’s desire to invest in the crypto-currency was gone for a long time.  4. Forgetting the wallet code. Not all crypto-owners trust digital or physical storages. Many of them rely on their own memory. In terms of security, this is one of the most reliable ways to store keys, but its reliability is very low. For example, Gideon Gibson Nweze, the founder of KickCity Company, once left his wallet in a taxi, charging the phone after the night walk. It would be possible to restore the wallet on another device, but only if the password was entered. However, Gideon never remembered the password. While he was creating a code, he decided to rely on his own memory, and it let him down at the most crucial moment. Not a single owner of crypto-currency is insured against such situation because the memory is a tricky thing.  5. An accident. Unfortunately, there is no insurance against the vicissitudes of fate as well. Even crypto-owners are mortal. As statistics show, 110 Bitcoin owners die every day, every 13 minutes a crypto-currency owner dies. And if none of his surroundings has access to the password, these savings will be unavailable forever and will turn into “dead bitcoins”. Unlike fiat funds, remaining funds in crypto-economy are not allocated anywhere and can’t be used by anyone.  Conclusion  Loss of your savings in bitcoins is easy enough even without attempts of hackers and fraudsters to crack them. Crypto-owners cope with this task themselves. First of all, such situations occur due to the fact that they do not know about a reliable way to protect their wallets. At the moment, the best known for protecting crypto-currency savings in case of loss of the access to the wallet — MyWish. MyWish application was created by Russian developers using Ethereum smart contracts. MyWish is a mobile application and a website where every person can create his own smart contract and manage it without special knowledge in the field of IT. Thanks to these contracts, it is possible to provide the transfer of savings to other user wallets of relatives’ ones in case of the unforeseen events. The service works as follows: for example, if the wallet is not active for 3 years, the funds are transferred to the reserve wallet. Terms and conditions of such contracts are set individually. Thus, the loss of the wallet key will not equal the loss of funds.    Official site: https://mywish.io/. Join the telegram group for more information: https://t.me/MyWish_EN",False

MyWish Pre-ICO raised $220k during the pre-ICO, 170% of cap. Now, MyWish is preparing for the ICO, which will start on October, 25. Official site: https://mywish.io/. Join the telegram group for more information: https://t.me/MyWish_EN  “The idea of platform MyWish interested me long before we started development of the project. The issue of inheritance of digital assets is long overdue, and I raised it in an article on Cointelegraph in early 2016. Back then I realized that there are no such services yet.(https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-investment-heritage).  2 years later, to my surprise, I saw the realization of my ideas on the blockchain festival ICO Hypethon in St. Petersburg, where MyWish team presented their project Last Will. I liked the approach of the developers, website design and their marketing strategy.  Despite some mourning topics, which the project raises, I believe that people need a strategic approach to possession of digital assets. Owners of cryptocurrencies do not live forever, and the question of succession will fall rise very soon in the crypto space.  Developers of MyWish touched on a really important issue and approached it from a technological point of view. Their platform issues other smart contracts, such as marriage contractы, deferred paymentы, transfer of funds to backup walletы in case of loss of the key.  Cases of wallets losses are not uncommon. Several my friends have lost wallets and access to it, or have broken their memory sticks. I know one person who threw his laptop with the recorded key of hundreds of bitcoins. When he realized that his bitcoins are worth millions of dollars, he rushed to restore memory. Fortunately, he was able to recover his keys.  We all know that a huge number of bitcoins are lost forever. The last transactions for many wallets was carried out 5–6 years ago when bitcoins were $10. At that time, 10–20 bitcoins had no value to their owners and they simply have simply forgotten about their savings.  But the growing price of cryptocurrencies has significantly changed the situation and that’s why MyWish has great prospects. I understand that not everyone can reasonably approach the issue of inheritance of cryptocurrencies and evaluate strategic and tactical importance of unilateral transactions on smart contracts. Maybe not too many people know about the platform, but the project will eventually attract your attention. I think that the new wedding contract will become very popular.  A an adviser to the project, I recommend you to participate in the ICO or use smart contracts based on MyWish platform.”    MyWish is preparing for the ICO, which will start on October, 25.

We would like to clarify one important moment. MyWish project is sometimes described as a smart-contract library but it’s not completely right. Why? Because library is simply a list of available resources held together.  However, MyWish team does not only checks contracts that will be used in the future, but also implements them into our systems, such as Joule contract evocation system, development and verification series and so on. Therefore, the contracts become unified and elaborated. Also we granted an open access to the third-party developers and expect more contracts to work with.  Another feature that deserves mentioning is a seamless contract customization for any user. You don’t need to have programmer experience if you need a smart contract for your particular situation. Sign in, make up your own settings and get the result.  As simple as that.  All of it is possible because MyWish operates as a high-grade blockchain platform, not just another contract library.",False

We decided to move the ICO date forward because of MyWish rebranding , active work on product improvement and ongoing negotiations with key partners.  After the launch of ICO, we received valuable feedback from the community and our advisors. We realized that MyWish can provide much more opportunities than was initially planned.  People are used to asset management in the world of fiat money. Our mission — create such services in the digital economy. Last month of our work was devoted to this.  We worked on expanding MyWish services, such as automatic payments, wedding contracts and deferred payments — creating a more extensive and reliable solution for the market. The development of the platform has advanced a lot and agreements have been reached with key partners. We also conducted several events, having tested our product in action. Currently, negotiations are under way with three new advisers to join our advisory board.  To demonstrate all the novelties and values of MyWish platform to the community, the campaign will be relaunched in late October. We took care of well-being of current ICO participants and developed a mechanic for reimbursements. Each investor will be able to receive a refund. The manual will be published no later than October 10th. All pre-ICO participants will keep tokens that will be automatically exchanged for new ICO tokens in late October.  We are confident that the all-new MyWish platform will generate interest in the crypto community and become a service that solves a real problem for crypto-owners.

Having smart contracts library (even we create it & deploy it) is not enough. Contracts shall be called. In case of our contracts which can exists several years we need to guarantee that contract will be called in accordance with schedule, even if our platform is broken/closed.

Using Third party apps defeats any single purpose of using the Ethereum network! A smart contract should be 100% trustless. So in fact, you're releasing a closed source application with just a fundraiser written in Ethereum as I understand.  So even if your code would be 100% ok (wich, i seriously doubt given the fact that you don't even understand Ethereum, let alone coding!), users still just need to 'trust' any 'third party' application with their funds? Then why using Ethereum at all? There's nothing transparent or trustless about the way you're handling this.  That being said, 1 look at your Git gives me the impression you have 0 coding knowledge. Your source is butt ugly, pourly written, lack of security checks, bad formatted, wrong comment tags, ..... The way you explain things only confirms that your understanding of the entire Ethereum blockchain principle is close to very beginner.

Here is simple arithmetic:  Data about the amount of cryptocurrencies' owners from University of Cambridge research paper: ""The current number of unique active users of crypocurrency wallets is estimated to be between 2.9 million and 5.8 million."" (1). The research was published in May, so it is reasonable to assume that today the amount of users is closer to 5 million, rather than 3 million.   Data about the amount of daily deaths: 151,600 people die every day (2)  The ratio of people using cryptocurrency in the world: 5 million / 7000 billion = 0.0007  Multiply the amount of daily deaths and the ratio of people using crypto: 0.0007 * 151,600 = 106.12  Thus, approximately 110 BTC owners die everyday.

Especially given the fact, that the leading cause of death is cardiovascular diseases which mainly means dying of old age. If you give me statistics of people over 65 using cryptocurrencies, I would be surprised to see a significant number. And then on the other cause of death including infections and various diseases in less developed parts of the world certainly can't be included in the cryptocurrency users statistics as they barely have an access to electricity, not to talk about child deaths etc. What I'm trying to say is that cryptocurrency users actually are not a part of the dying kind as they are mostly young and live in developed countries.
