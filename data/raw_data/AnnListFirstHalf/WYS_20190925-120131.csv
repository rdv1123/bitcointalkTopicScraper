Over the course of the past months we have been assessing all listing options. We opted for two main exchange platforms to list the wys token in the beginning. Three main factors were essential for our decision: Listing fees, security and exchange architecture.  The crypto exchange market has been overheating in the past months. Crypto Exchanges nowadays charge up to USD 1 million for token listings. A listing in one of the major exchanges can certainly have a positive effect on daily trading volume. However, at the same time, it is not appropriate for projects like wysker to pay excessive sums for listings on these major centralized exchanges (CEX).  Our plan is to further establish the wys token as an utility token in the e-commerce market. Thus we are working on a steady growth of the wysker platform and allocate our ICO funds accordingly. For this reason, we opted to list the wys token on two decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the beginning.  So what is the difference between a centralized and decentralized exchange? To put it short, CEXs act like banks. You have to create a new exchange-controlled wallet and need to trust the provider with your funds. In contrast, DEXs enable trading of tokens directly from a holder’s private wallet. You never have to give up control over your funds.  CEXs can not always provide full security, as shown in several cases. The whole point of decentralized concepts is to not hand over control to third parties. The centralized approach raises the risk of mismanagement, scams and hacking.  With increasing adoption, it seems like 2018 will be the year for DEXs. Nearly all major CEXs, such as Binance, are working on their own version of DEXs to keep up with the game. We are pleased to announce that we were able to list the wys token on two of the most promising DEX projects in the market: Radar Relay and Next.Exchange.",False

It is a revolution. It turns the common online retail and advertising data model on its head — by using blockchain technology to secure and “pay” users for their data. It is inspiration and shopping platform at once. It offers a unique way to “speed browse” unique and care and thoughtfully curated products in a variety of categories.  All those ideas put wysker in the spotlight — at speed we didn’t expect. For us, it feels a bit like browsing products with the wysker app. There is always a pleasant surprise around the corner. Getting awarded at the prestigious Netexplo and UNESCO Innovation Awards 2018 for example. Or reaching the semi-finals at the equally important Slush Tokyo conference 2018. Another symptom: the web is turning magenta and violet. A simple image search for wysker turns screens mauve. wysker is present, and wysker is everywhere.  Now cynics may point out that probably the marketing & communications department does an excellent job here. Hard work and a great branding strategy: and voìla! But that is only a part of the truth. wysker’s branding strategy is more than just a marketing idea. It is an entire belief system. Our app and our marketing are just tools to make these beliefs a reality.  Every single wysker image on the Google search marks a milestone for us. Every mauve picture has meaning. Because it marks us getting one step closer to turning beliefs into facts.    But progress to where? We would be dishonest if we’d claim, we don’t want economic success. Yes, financial success is important to us. But even more important is to establish the idea of a one-to-one data trade between retailers and advertisers on one side and users on the other. Even more, weight carries the fact that we get closer to hand back the control over data to the users.  In the wake of the EU law, we see many data giants claiming the same. But none is as radical and revolutionary as wysker. Full data rights for our users are ingrained in our DNA. And not because law requires it — but because it is our very business model. And with every step in our evolution, we aim to get closer to this goal. Full data control, full data rights and fair participation in data profits for our users.  But where are we today? We are working on wysker 2.0. We will implement new features that mark further milestones: Training sessions for your wysker, customization features and a re-invented notification center are just a few of the new features. But not only the wysker app keeps evolving. Our branding continually grows with it. Even our logo took a step to the next level.    We are conscious that we have been relatively silent on medium. The truth is: our dedicated team worked day and night on making the wysker vision real. And blogging simply took a back seat. To our readers, investors, and users we want to say: “We are sorry!”. But then we know — you understand. At the end of the day we are working for you, our users, our investors and our big vision.  https://medium.com/wysker/the-evolution-of-wysker-79e1c3374b38",False

The game is inspired by Notpron, one of my most favourite game and one of the toughest online-games on earth. It kept me inside the house for days even though my friends were playing outside in the sun.  To promote the wys token, we didn’t just want to create simple banner ads that spread out all the trending keywords: crypto, coins, Lambos, moon, hodl, whale, fud, pump and dump. So we thought, how to do something different? How to create something fun and challenging? That’s why we created the wysker treasure hunt.  The hunt began a while ago and no one has solved it yet. It’s a tough nut to crack, but it’s fun. The feedback so far has been phenomenal. We receive tons of feedback especially by people who have not been active in the crypto-sphere.

If I am correct you want to sell slightly above half of it in the ICO (1'782'692'308 WYS), which brings the above figure down to let's say 60,000,000 EUR. Ok, let us even take the 30% and 15% discounts, make it an average of 20% and deduct this from this 60mln EUR. We still end up with 48,000,000 EUR.  And you want to persuade the community, that your highly educated and experienced founders do not have 25,000 EUR to set up a regular limited liability company in Germany, which requires a minimal capital of 25,000 EUR? I can only draw the following conclusion: the team - or at least the founders - do not believe in this project enought to put 25K EUR out of their own pockets in order to get 50 mln EUR from the market! What kind of approach is that?!?  For the readers, who do not understand the difference between GmbH and UG companies I paste some links below from official sites https://www.stuttgart.ihk24.de/english/fairplay/Company_Law/GmbH_and_UG_haftungsbeschraenkt_Information_on_their_Foundati/679026 (IHK stands for Chamber of Commerce and Industry) https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unternehmergesellschaft_(haftungsbeschr%C3%A4nkt) (You can translate this into English easily)  The bottom-line dear friends is, that a UG is considered as a joke in the German reality - no one wants to deal with you as an UG because you are not treated serious - to have a capital of a few Euros...Ask any notary or lawyer or experienced enterpreneur in Germany if you do not believe teh above. I know what I am saying, because I had such a company set up myself.  Oh, and by the way - if you would like to see where the seat of this not-yet-48MLN EUR company is, then here you go - in a HOSTEL?!?  https://www.google.pl/maps/place/Novalisstra%C3%9Fe+14,+10115+Berlin,+Niemcy/@52.5282767,13.3887483,3a,75y,228h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1su7K8hGe69p5OqrIJvDA59Q!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo2.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3Du7K8hGe69p5OqrIJvDA59Q%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dsearch.TACTILE.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D86%26h%3D86%26yaw%3D228.45786%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a851e94ed83f83:0xf3af760922b9a863!8m2!3d52.5281506!4d13.3885664  Congrats on you credibility...again!

As you have pointed out some interesting thoughts and concerns, I would like to use the opportunity to provide some clarification. First, wysker being an UG and not a GmbH has the very simple reason. We started the company almost two years ago and back then founded everything from our own pockets. Choosing a UG to startup back then was the fastest and easiest way to set up a legal entity for our endeavours. For that, we also invested 6k EUR personally and financed us privately until the beginning of our ICO. However, you’re right a GmbH has a more solid appeal and we’re currently in the process of converting wysker UG to wysker GmbH.  Second, our office being in a Hostel sounds off course scary. However, that’s just the problem of Google Maps we’re the hostel shares the same address. Since November 2017, we also moved to another location at Paul-Lincke-Ufer 8d in Berin Kreuzberg as we needed a bigger office. You can check out our Facebook or Twitter we”re you can find some impression from the inside. It’s 220 square meters filled with real people working on wysker full time. Lastly, regarding the high hard cap, I totally understand your point. We’ve set this cap back in in September where the Ether value was much lower. Due to the parity hack we had to extend our ICO we did not want to change many conditions to make all further token purchases fair to our existing investors. However, we”re currently considering to adjust the hardcap accordingly.  I really hope the short statement reduces your concerns. I’m well aware that in the ICO space, there are a lot of sketchy and spammy projects and I understand that each project should be analyzed with extreme care. I can assure you that wysker is real and that every member involved in the project is committed to make it a success. Let me know if that was helpful or if you have any more concerns.  All the Best from Berlin, Ann-Lauriene",False

Over the last 15 years there has been no radical innovation in e-commerce. By solving mobile discovery, the wysker platform unlocks a multi-billion dollar opportunity. It is a radically new shopping experience that generates breakthrough data. Through the use of the blockchain it returns data ownership to its users. The result is consumer empowerment and unparalleled sales potential for retailers and advertisers.

Get early access on [ wysker.com ]        The benefits of blockchain- based advertising  The blockchain is at the core of the wysker platform, allowing users and advertisers to have a direct relationship while protecting consumer privacy and preventing fraud. It cuts out the middleman and enables a new concept we call “advertising based on consent”. In this model, the user is in control of their data and can give selective access in exchange for wys tokens.      A new token designed for digital commerce  The wys token gives consumers discounts for product views, advertisers access to customers, and retailers new opportunities to increase their sales. It’s an ERC20 utility token that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Here is how it works:   https://i.imgur.com/695jPZY.png     Sustained growth of the wys token economy  The wys token  follows the basic principle of supply and demand. The more users join the wysker platform, the greater the advertiser demand and the higher the wys Token value. To maximise user growth, 10% of all wys Tokens are reserved for user incentivization. An install bonus and a referral program are in place to boost product adoption.   https://i.imgur.com/VzNJwvc.png     Our goal is to establish a stable and fast-growing wys token economy. We have reserved 60% of all tokens for investors to fuel the growth of the wysker platform. With the remainder, we are inviting a growing number of retailers and advertisers to become major players in the wysker ecosystem.  https://i.imgur.com/VgOG6sn.png       Our roadmap to growing the wys token value  1⃣    11/17 - Presale wys token exclusive presale  2⃣    01/18 - wysker App launch global on Android / iOS  3⃣    01/18 - Token sale public wys token ICO  4⃣    04/18 - Trading token listed on exchanges  5⃣    06/18 - Retailer growth retailers onboarding  6⃣    01/19 - Ad Platform ad platform launched     Our vision for expanding the wysker experience  The wysker technology has the potential to be integrated into all kinds of platforms.

Recap: After the recent Parity bug we had to restatr https://medium.com/wysker/solving-a-big-challenge-our-ico-continuous-today-13d8ace52fb4. We successfully moved all existing wys tokens to our new smart contract and granted each investor a 1.25 multiple. On November 17th, 2017, our new presale kicked-off with a minimum investment of 25 ETH. Since the launch, we’ve received tons of requests from people wanting to invest smaller amounts. At the same time, the ETH price is exploding and because of this we’ve made a decision.  News: From today onwards, we’re opening our presale to all investors by removing the minimum investment requirement. To keep it fair for the community and for anyone who has already invested, all investments below 25 ETH will get a 15% token bonus and the exceeding ones still receive the existing 30% bonus. The presale volume for smaller investments is also capped to a maximum of 2460 ETH, the equivalent of roughly one million USD. The supply is limited on a first come first serve basis. Everyone who wants to stock up their wys tokens or wants to invest smaller amounts can do so on www.wystoken.org  Hardcap: We also want to use the opportunity to address our hardcap. When we started our ICO back in October, we’ve set our hard cap to 108k ETH (approx. 25m USD at that time). With the change of plans due to the Parity incident, our timeline has stretched to quite an extend. As we didn’t want to make any changes to our existing plan, we kept the hardcap and continued our ICO under the same conditions. As the ETH price has almost doubled since October, our hardcap increased to a whooping $50m USD.  Reality: With the rising ETH value, our hardcap is now an ambitious goal. However, we’re a platform with enormous potential. The wysker app is ready to launch worldwide on Android and iOS on January 31st, 2018 and features a portfolio exceeding 50'000 products. No matter what the final result of our ICO will be, we’re investing all of our efforts into expanding the wysker platform, improving its performance and scaling it globally. What follows is an increase of the wys token value.  Thank you for being a part of wysker and joining us along the way. Together we can make it happen.  Best from Berlin, Tobi (Founder CEO)",False

If I decide to invest now 10 ETH, I'll get a 15% instead of 30% bonus right? I would assume a higher risk and I would have around 4.000€ ""frozen"" for a 15% bonus.  Or I can wait until the ICO, the bonus would still be the same 15%, I would have more information, plus in the meantime, I can use the 4.000€ to invest in other cryptos/business.  So... What is the incentive to invest now?",False

It works like this: The wysker app shows a set of ten similar products in a blisteringly fast repetition. If you move your thumb over the display, the tempo changes or you switch to the next set.  This ADHD-meets-shopping approach wants to be the answer to a huge problem of e-commerce: “We Solve Discovery,” says wysker CEO Haag. Nobody overlooks the sheer amount products that are spreaded across online stores. Correspondingly large is the risk to never discover your potential dream pieces of clothing. That’s why wysker uses curated fashion sets based on different fashion styles to make product discovery maximum efficient.  Practical but not yet the “monster vision behind it”, as Haag calls it. Unlike Facebook or Google, wysker captures the preferences of users more precisely. The app tracks every finger movement and quickly knows exactly what a user wants. However, the data is not simply sold to advertisers. wysker has a far more complex approach: Users can make money with their anonymous data via so-called wys tokens, the apps’ own cryptocurrency. They receive these for usage of the app. In addition, shop owners can buy and use wys tokens to attract users.  Wys tokens can be exchanged for the cryptocurrency Ethereum in advance of the launch. This so-called Initial Coin Offering, the first in Germany, not only attracted attention but also raised capital for growth. The app is scheduled to go live at the end of January. Then, it will become clear whether Haag succeeds in turning the balance of power in e-commerce on its head.”  And here’s the German version (original)  “Diese App ist wie auf dem Fahrrad durch Primark rasen und trotzdem die besten Teile entdecken. Es funktioniert so: Auf dem wysker-Screen wird ein Set von zehn ähnlichen Produkten in rasend schneller Wiederholung gezeigt. Bewegt man den Daumen übers Display, ändert sich das Tempo, oder man wechselt ins nächste Set.  Dieser ADHS-meets-Shopping-Ansatz will Antwort auf ein Riesenproblem des E-Commerce sein: “Wir lösen Discovery”, sagt wysker-CEO Haag. Keiner überblickt mehr die Menge über zig Stores verteilter Produkte. Entsprechend groß ist das Risiko, potenziellen Lieblingsklamotten nie zu begegnen. Darum wyskers auf Basis unterschiedlicher Modestile kuratierte Fashion-Sets, die User maximal effizient sichten können.  Praktisch. Aber noch nicht die “Monstervision dahinter”, wie Haag es nennt. Im Unterschied zu Facebook oder Google erfasse wysker die Vorlieben der User präziser. Die App trackt jede Fingerbewegung und weiß schnell exakt, wer was will. Die Daten werden aber nicht schlicht an Werbetreibende verkauft. wysker hat einen komplexeren Ansatz: Der User kann seine anonymisierte Daten selbst zu Geld machen: über sogenannte wys Token, eine App-eigene Kryptowährung. Diese bekommt er für die Nutzung der App. Zudem können Shopbetreiber wys Token kaufen und einsetzen, um User anzulocken.  Wys Token konnten im Vorfeld des Launches gegen die Kryptowährung Ethereum getauscht werden. Dieses sogenannte Initial Coin Offering, das erste in Deutschland, hat wysker neben Aufmerksamkeit Kapital zum Wachstum verschafft. Nun soll die App Ende Januar live gehen. Dann wird sich zeigen, ob es Haag gelingt, die Machtverhältnisse im E-Commerce auf den Kopf zu stellen.”",False
