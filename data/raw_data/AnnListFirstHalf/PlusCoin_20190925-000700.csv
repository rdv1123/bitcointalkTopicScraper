Initially, the idea of P2P was to make the platform work on the common Blockchain Ethereum. But such a task would be too simple and in the future the platform would greatly slow down the work of the Ethereum network. The team decided to create its own private Blockchain and implement it in the work of P2P PlusCoin. This task took a lot of time, money and effort, but we did it! Today is officially announced the opening of the platform P2P PlusCoin.  What are the important points to know about P2P PlusCoin? - P2P is a trading platform that runs on a private Blockchain, and in order to replenish the balance, you must enter the address of your Ethereum wallet in your account and then transfer the PLCN to the deposit address that appears (automatic and fast process) - you can post products, communicate with sellers and buyers using sections located in your personal account - use filters to make searching more convenient - moderation of goods sent for placement, lasts up to 24 hours - do not press the “confirm delivery” button until you have received the goods - P2P platform is intuitive and simple. Important fact: “This is the first version of P2P, further improvements will be made. Also, the opportunity to bid for ETH, BTC, various Altcoins, etc. will be organized soon. ” All suggestions and advice you can write in chat rooms and media project DS PLUS (PlusCoin).  https://shop.dsplus.pro/    Official website https://pluscoin.io Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/dspluscoin/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/DsplusF Telegram channel: https://t.me/Dsplusforkeng Telegram chat: https://t.me/PlusCoinENG Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2067375.0 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/PlusCoin/",False

The Fcoin GPM company is accused of causing it. However, not only due to their actions, the network has been practically closed for ERC-20 tokens transactions, many projects (frogs, shrimps, cats …) use the Ethereum Blockchain for useless operation confirmations in the common network, thereby make the network go through a really tough time.  On the one hand, this is a challenge for the Ethereum developers. Scaling is an acute problem which has already been solved, however, as we can see, there is still room for improvement.  On the other hand, there is a way out that DS PLUS (PlusCoin) uses: private Blockchain. It does not load the common Ethereum network and can ensure that all data about committed transactions are posted in the Blockchain. Yes, it is much more complicated than using a ready-to-use shared public network. But the action of cats, shrimps, frogs, etc. are irresponsible, because their developers were well aware of how much data would appear in the network confirmations and how it will affect all other operations.  Therefore, now the issue of PLC- PLCN exchange has become acute. A few days transactions appear in the network, for a long time they stay in the “Pending” status and disappear, due to the impossibility of confirmation on the part of the Ethereum Blockchain.   We hope that in the nearest future the situation will be resolved and ERC-20 coins movement will be commited in the standard mode.  Official site: https://pluscoin.io",False

We are pleased to inform you that the DS Plus project team (PlusCoin) is launching a private testing of the P2P platform.  P2P PlusCoin is the first e-Commerce platform where everyone can place goods, exchange then for the PlusCoin cryptocurrency, and buy goods from other users for their coins.  For the platform (and the DS PLUS application in the future) the technical department developed a private Blockchain, based on the Ethereum Blockchain. Its advantage is that each transaction, regardless of the amount and other factors, has no commission and confirmations does not last longer than 1 minute.  We would be happy if you would like to take part in testing one of the first real e-Commerce products that uses the unique Blockchain technology.  The technical department has already conducted the first tests and prepared everything to simulate the trading situation in real time.  In this regard, the team decided to hold a competition among our tokenholders. The prize will be 20 registered accounts with PlusCoins.  What will be the process of the testing?      The essence of testing will be following: you, as a participant, provide any product for exchanging on the platform — it can be anything you’d like and this product does not have to be new. Just look around what you could offer for placement, prepare a picture of the product, description and price in rubles or dollars (no more than 50 USD). The same actions will be performed by all other participants of the test.     There will be a certain number of coins (600 000–800 000 PLCN) on the winners’ personalized accounts, which you will be able to spend on P2P goods, that will be placed by other participants.  The testing will begin August 1, 2018.  How to become a winner in this competition?      Tokenholder creates some content about the project — it can be a video review, an article, infographics, etc. We will not narrow your ideas and ways of its realization. Top 20 works will be selected by team members and the creators of these works will become the winners + they will receive registered accounts with PlusCoins.     After creating some content about the DS PLUS (PlusCoin) project, send your data to the email address: market@pluscoin.io     - Name / Nickname     - Nickname in Telegram (@________)     - Link to your created and hosted content      The competition will start on July 24, 2018 and finish on July 31, 2018     On August 1, 2018 we will announce the list of winners     On August 1, 2018 the private testing of P2P among the winners of the competition and third-party invited participants starts.",False

I`m CTO of the project. I`ve decided that it`s necessary to explain reasons of postponing the start of the Black Friday. Unfortunately, the sale will be postponed again. I beg a pardon on behalf of all technical service. Those of you who are familiar with the Ethereum blockchain understand that it`s necessary to have our own nodes to let the Marketplace work (to create and manage deposits). Some time ago a vulnerability of these nodes was found. Some deposits were compromised; all PLC tokens will be refunded before the start of Black Friday. We have been working all week in order to increase security, but, since our nodes were on servicing, a “desynchronization” with other network has happened. We were prepared for this situation; unfortunately, it took more time to synchronize than we thought. This process has no fixed time to be done, and it can take from several hours to a week and even more. The technical service of the Marketplace is working hard to solve this issue with nodes. We haven`t slept for almost 3 days already. The latest our block (at the moment when this post was written) is 99.86% synchronized and falls short of the network for 6500 blocks. I suppose that synchronization will be finished by 13.00 UTC. Nevertheless, I`ve seen many times that last blocks are downloading much slower than others (regardless of the used type of blocks, parity or geth). That is why it was decided to postpone the sale to the 2nd of February (it`s my bad that it hasn`t been done yesterday). As soon as the nearest node will be synchronized, we will open the Marketplace again; you will be able to take a look at products and make deposits. As for the hacker attack, we will publish additional information in the immediate future. Thank you for understanding. I`m ready to answer all you questions about technical staff.""",False

As far as I know there is a backlog of over 350 Tokens that wait to get listed on ED, so it shouldnt be a problem for them to replace PLC by another token. They could still relist it after the ICO. Trading volume is also not that high. I think this would reduce trading a lot and safe investors money.

I was asking this question regarding the terminology of the token because the type of the token matters for the taxation in some countries. Utility tokens are handled differently than eg equitity tokens or currency ""only"" tokens. At least in my jurisdictation this matters already and will surely only be a matter of time until other countries will also implement some laws for all the new types of tokens. So maybe for tokens like PLC there will be a need for a Hybrid-token terminology, as there is not nothing in the law yet that applies directly to it. Time will tell.

The latest news of the ICO market in China and some other countries were discussed at a meeting. The representative of Alibaba Group, Alex Zhang, shared his opinion why such sentiments appeared in China: ""There were too many skam-projects in China, where people lost their money"". Mikhail Mikhaylov, the CEO of the PlusCoin project, also shared his view on this news: ""They do things differently in China. Governments and businesses are deeply integrated there. Probably, China has chosen other development patterns for the blockchain technologies, that’s why the traditional ICO and speculation on cryptocurrencies can impose additional risks for them. However, we are writing history all together, and the future of humanity depends on what step we are taking now. ICO is one of such steps."" The DS Plus project, its possibilities and benefits for people and enterprisers were also discussed during the meeting. The commodity and money infrastructure, which is being created by the DS Plus (PlusCoin) team, was a central theme of the conversation. It`s a brand new system of instant transactions between users of the application and partner companies, who works with the DS Plus system. All the transactions are carried out in the PlusCoin cryptocurrency. The representatives of Alibaba Group admitted that they liked the idea and saw many opportunities to use it. It was the first meeting between the parties and, I suppose, not the last. Perhaps, the next meeting between the DS Plus team and the representatives of Alibaba Group will take place in China. We hope to find the common interests and the opportunity for fruitful cooperation.",False

DS PLUS - is a decentralized platform for organization of loyalty systems in businesses, which uses Ethereum Network. On the users' side that is an infrastructural application which includes cashback service with integrated cryptocurrency named PlusCoin, P2P platform allowing exchange of goods for the app coins, safe crypto-wallet, zero-comission transactions and a possibility to start new directions in the app's work (new elements of the system).  PlusCoin - is a cryptocurrency integrated in the work of DS PLUS mobile app and its services. The coin is based on Ethereum Network (ERC-20 Token). The coin cannot be received through classic mining, however there are other ways of gaining it. The first one is purchasing it at various exchanges. The second one is receiving it in DS PLUS app for purchases from partners (cashback), commiting certain actions, visiting sites etc. The coin supports work of the monetary exchange infrastructure in DS PLUS mobile app. The coin has ticker ""PLCN"" in Ethereum Network, and once integration with blockchain is done the coin's ticker in the mobile app will be ""AppPLCN"". The both coins will be available for exchange in the internal exchanger integrated in DS PLUS mobile app.  You may learn the offer from the links below.  AppStore GooglePlay   We create independent tool for cashback accruing (cashback is a loyalty enhancing tool providing a part of the sum of a purchase as a customer's remuneration), which is used by partners of the app. What is cashback itself as a tool today? There are few services in the field of e-commerce successfully supporting the process of funds returning as a part of a purchase sum from large online retailers, but it is necessary to commit a row of actions which are quite difficult for a various customer, and the period of refunding destines 2 months, and the remuneration should be shared with a service that provides such refunding. In offline cashback is a prerogative of banking systems, a cashback will be refunded within a month and the percentage of refunding from the biggest part of retailers is quite small and consists about 1-2%. Of course, there is a row of partners of a bank which will provide even 15%, but usually those retailers are of no interest for a customer, or a big remuneration will only be provided for the very first purchase.  Our goal - is to attract maximal amount of users and counter-parties in using of cryptocurrency and blockchain via mechanism of instant accruing of PlusCoin in a role of cashback for purchases from our partners. Accruing of cryptocurrency itself will not reach the goal, so that is why we develop additional services based on Ethereum Network contributing to turnover and realization of PlusCoin. They will also build infrastructure for further development of the whole industry.  Business model, financial model  Model of interaction with counter-parties: Currently the basis of work of DS PLUS service if providing a fine and developing tool for organization of innovative loyalty systems in business, on the users' side this is a comfortable and simple tool for using such systems for receiving personal gain. After integration with the private blockhain is completed, counter-parties will motivate users to commit purchases from them for following accruing of PlusCoin (AppPLCN) to their balances.  Further interaction with counter-parties is as follows: at the first stage of PlusCoin integration in traditional markets a counter-party replenishes its balance in PlusCoin by purchasing it in a personal account for set PCEP price (PlusCoin Exchanger Price). The value of PCEP is defined with current exchanging rate of PlusCoin. A counter-party sets a fixed sum or a percentage from a purchase (x) can be provided as a cashback in the personal account. An amount of PlusCoin will be provided to a user as a result of a deal is defined with following formula: (A*x/100)/(PCEP*USD price), ""A"" is a sum of a purchase; USD price - rate of US dollar to the fiat currency was used for commiting a purchase. PlusCoin accruing may also happen when a user visit a counter-party, the fact of visiting is being fixed with geolocation and iBeacon sensors located in sale-spots.   Another important moment of DS PLUS work is three types of counter-parties:  A ""Cold"" counter-party is a partner that is not ready to control PlusCoin accruing on its own, in that case accruing of PlusCoin is being controlled by DS PLUS or another marketer - lead generator - that uses PlusCoin;  A second-order counter-party - is ready to shift to the new system and control PlusCoin accruing to the users on its own, but not ready yet to accept PlusCoin as a payment for its goods or services;  A first-order counter party - is ready to shift to the new system and control PlusCoin accruing itself and ready to accept PlusCoin as a payment with following valuation: N (the increase coefficient) * PCEP * Price in PlusCoin. For example: if the price of a good is $100 and PCEP is $0,02 and the market price in PlusCoin is 5000 PLCN (AppPLCN), the increase coefficient was chosen by a counter-party is 1.6 that means a counter-party is able to sell a good for $160 in PlusCoin gaining 60% of additional profit. The maximal value of the increase coefficient is 2.0, the minimal one is not limited. There will be a recommended value of the increase coefficient for every single group of goods. The increase coefficient shall motivate partners to accept PlusCoin during the initial phase of integration in traditional markets.  The users not relevant to the crypto-society and not interested in blockchain and cryptocurrencies will be able to spend accumulated PlusCoin on the P2P platform, or others that accept PlusCoin or via purchasing goods from first-order counter-parties. DS PLUS P2P platform will place counter-parties' and the app users' goods. The users, with their knowledge of PlusCoin status, will be able to manage the accumulated coins (exchangers, exchanges, etc.). An internal exchanger will be integrated in the DS PLUS mobile app for the users' convenience. Also there will be opportunity to commit transactions in PlusCoin between the app users via integrated wallet interface.
