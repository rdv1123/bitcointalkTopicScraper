Click here to participate Token generation event starts April 10th Join our Telegram discussion View our whitepaper  https://blok.network/assets/img/ann/linkedin.png  Telegram l Website l Facebook l Twitter l Steemit | Medium l Reddit l LinkedIn  Overview  We at Blok are democratizing the gig economy by empowering the next generation, on-demand workforce through the Ethereum blockchain. Blok connects on-demand workers with verified opportunities through our open source platform. Utilizing smart contracts we eliminate current frictions in the gig economy.  Working nine to five for a single employer will be the minority by 2020. The strategy for millions of people is to compile various income streams and being their own boss rather than in traditional employment. Escaping the cubicle is within reach for millions of workers, Blok will assist in helping them achieve this freedom.  How Blok Works  Blok leverages blockchain technology to connect employers and on-demand workers across the globe. The Blok directory uses smart contracts to eliminate friction in terms of time, cost, quality, and transparency in matching workers and companies.   A company creates a gig that is verified in the Blok directory. A Blokpreneur (an on-demand worker) can then search the directory and apply directory to the gig. This relationship provides a better and faster solution in fulfilling consumer needs in the on-demand economy. Blok allows consumers, companies, and workers all to benefit from blockchain technology.  https://blok.network/assets/img/ann/relations.png?u=1  Token Supply  Total of 360,000,000 tokens will be minted. Of the minted tokens, 65% will be sold during the initial token generation event. Further, 85% of the token supply will be used to further Blok’s mission through platform development, marketing, and operational expenses. A precise break is as follows: 4% for the bounty program, referral programs, community events and partnerships. 13% to the team, advisors and early contributors. All of the tokens provided to the team will be vested over 24 months with a 3-month cliff. 18% reserve 65% for the ICO Unsold tokens during the ICO will be burned  Usage of BLK Token  The BLK token facilitates payment for finished gigs to the on-demand workers. The tokens generated on the Ethereum blockchain will pay for finished gigs, like ridesharing, delivering groceries, transcribing receipts, answering supports calls or more complex ones, like designing graphics, providing financial advice, or answering medical questions.  Advantages to using BLK over fiat and other cryptocurrencies include, locale, payment-method-independence, and specific blockchain-independence.  Bounty Program  Stay tuned for more information about Blok’s bounty program. We will have a translation bounty so reserve your languages below!
