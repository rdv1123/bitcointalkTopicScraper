We actually canceled Bitcointalk follow up as the Bitcointalk was not in the first line. We are working on the move from MVP, which is available to test on EMMARES.COM to the final product based on the big data concept and effective synonym search using social preferences with machine learning to enhance search results to the needs of the users.  About the tokens : exactly what we stated and that is standing :  In case of reaching the Maximum Threshold, any unsold Available EMA tokens will be burned. In case the Maximum Threshold is not reached, any unsold Available EMA tokens will be stored by EMMARES for additional distribution stages announced in the future.  So we didn't reach max cap and usold tokens are stored for future additional distribution stage as it was stated in the papers.  About exchanges - making exchange listing in the situation as it was on the exchanges, was in our opinion not the best move. To protect investors, we want to move the first version of the final product to the market and start the token flow with the project. We believe, that such timing can protect the real value of EMMARES tokens. But we are open to good suggestions of the community.",False

In  the past the only way of ""advertising"" on the email sphere was ""pushing"" the information to as many usually uninterested customers. That is exact definition of spam and also the reason, we all hate deleting spam every day. EMMARES is bringing new perspective in email marketing. Let us assume, that we have good and legal content provider, whose content is valuable to some targeted groups and others, who are just junk. Believe or not, there are also customers, who want information on Casinos or similar content, which is by the most of us unappreciated. Reputation directory will offer exactly the reputation score for various types of information and will help to reach information, which is valuable for us and from the area, which is of our interest.  It will help users to make opt in to the best providers from certain area and to make easy opt out from those, who failed to meet their criteria. EMMARES does NOT send any content by itself and does NOT share any email info. But EMMARES builds transparent and trusted content reputation directory and based on that directory services, which helps recipients and marketers to connect.  Thank you for the question. We believe, that this is exactly the point of success for EMMARES eco system.  To be a little more descriptive :  Recipient receives email from his usual airline company, to which he opted in some time ago. He is interested in special fares. As the airline decides to provide EMMARES rewarding pool, he will receive a footer, where he rates the content of that mail. As he is impressed by the offer, he gives 5* to the email content. Evaluation is received by the EMMARES system, written in the side chain and remains unchangeable, and the airline is getting good reputation score. On the EMMARE recipient portal there is a page with top lists of content reputation scores for providers by the content type. Is any other user clicks on airlines, he will see that particular airline in the directory with good score and he will be able to opt in for that information, as also that user would like to get good airfare offers.  So easy searchable content system with reputation scores to help to choose good or the best providers for the area, which is in  the interest of that interested recipient.   Latter in  the glottalization stage, when amount of rated providers will be big enough, an API is planned for anti spam systems, which will filter out all unrated emails, which are type of mass mailing. On such way, everybody will be able to reduce the spam amount drastically and participate in  the health of whole email eco system with rating content providers and on such way earn rewards from EMMARES rating system.",False

To resume - less quantity and better quality in email arena, reduction of spam and easy access to prooved good content by individual choice. Paying for reading would be to easy :-) That is not the idea...  Paying for rating the received content is base of reputation scores.",False

It is for a lot of people at first sight impression as you mentioned. But there are 4 billion email dresses in the world and every day 270 Billion mails are sent. 60% out of those are untargeted. Email marketing is one of the most powerful online tools with 4000% RoI - one of the highest in the industry. But all that comes with the price - spam. As today many of marketers think that easiest way of reaching more audience is to produce more blast, the result is bad reputation and spam. We want to stop this.  EMMARES is actual innovation, as it is creating visible ""directory"" of content quality by the type of content. Based on such ""directory"" everybody can : - find the best rated information from the fields, which he/she is interested in  (so no unwanted content-everybody will be able to order content which he chooses) - drop all mass mailing posts, which are below certain quality level or are unrated.  (effective block of all spam and low quality content)  On such way you will be able to clean your inbox and in the same time choose, what you want and get information which you want to receive.  Someone said - Emmares is for email as Google is for the web.  If I represent that in figures  : quantity of email marketing blast daily is over 150 Billion mails per day. That is huge quantity. And marketers will be able to expand audience only by producing excelent content - on which people will opt in.  and not to forget : Emmares does NOT send any mails (so we do not produce mailings or spam) Emmares does not sell or share any email addresses  Emmares represents turn from current push systems to pull way. win-win fr everybody, Evan for non marketers, as everybody today is affected by spam.",False

That are really good questions and I would love to answer them. First - EMMARES is NOT sending ANY emails. It is far away form cold sending or sendind anything. Evan more - we are NOT sharing any adresses or even sel them! That is something we do not support and is not connected to EMMARES.  EMMARES is legal and GDPR compliant. We are making a kind of ""directory"" of content quality and marketing content providers. Content quality is determined by grades, given by recipients. First question always is - which mails do recipients grade ?  - Answer - just normal mails, which are sent to them by their regular opted in partners - marketers.  EMMARES is NOT producing any additional blast!  Why should be this important? Because on  the web side you can always search for contetn and look at it through Google search or similar. For Email something like that didn't exist. As you know, we all are searching for some specific content and we do not want to be pushed with other, which does not interest us. EMMARES gives you a hand in easy searching and opting in to ONLY the content which is of your interest and gives you possibility to filter out all mass mailing content, which has lower quality rating or doesn't have rating at all. Such method reduces inbox spam drastically.  So thanks again for the question as it is common missunderstanding, we see. Until now, there were only PUSH systems in email, and that is the reason of such assive spam exsistance. EMMARES is the only PULL system and does not force anyting but just give oportunity to make healthy opt in to the best content. And community through content assessments helps in the determination, which content is the best and which is low quality.",False

But you can see your email box every day and add your junk folder. You Will see masive blast which is killing the email systems every day.

You missed the point, so let me be more explanatory. We are NOT creating email service. We are NOT creating an advertisement which would push mails! so that is what we Do NOT do. So we are NOT reinventing transport of the mail as it is invented many years ago and it is still the same. We are NOT dealing with deliverability, as that is the job of ESPs.  Now let me explain what we DO: As on the earth, there are 3,7 billion email recipients and every one of them statistically receives 3 spam emails per day, that represents a huge amount of unsolicited emails in the system. That emails are the result of poor politics of email marketers and spammers. As the cost of getting new ""regular"" email address and the recipient who really want the content of the sender (marketer) is around 150 $ each, many marketers are looking for false short ways and send the bulk of untargeted emails. Recipients feel that emails as spam. How to avoid that? EMMARES rewards recipients for evaluating the emails which they receive (EMMARES does not send them anything additionally etc - it is not spam machine). By evaluating the content quality recipients are rewarded for fair grading of the content quality. And if we have a statistical crowd, results are trusted and correct. (even elections they predict with very high degree by using 20% sample). Nobody can change the results, rewards are trusted as they are paid by smart contract... That makes a directory of content quality of marketers and their campaigns. Recipients have certain needs for content and it is not true, that nobody would want any of the content. Statistically again people use email marketing information and they want exactly targeted information type. What EMMARES does is, that generates an online ultimate directory of quality assessment of senders and recipients can by their will choose the best senders fro wanted content. That again makes room to filter out unrated content and low-quality senders...and we are on the way to different and better email world. Result - shortly - much less spam, better content, only wanted and ordered infrmation sources, less over al quantity of email messages, and transparent system for content retrieval.

The system enables receivers (everyday users) to pick their favorite topics and choose what kind of content they want to receive. It also includes them in the evaluation process since they have the ability to rate the senders (they rate each mail they receive). In return, they get EMA tokens from a rewarding pool that is provided by email sender (marketers). And this is where the blockchain technology steps in. Email marketers build up their reputation and ensure they have big enough rewarding pool in order to get enough ratings to be rated as one of the top senders. That way they can access targeted groups of their interest which in the end brings better email marketing results and higher ROI.  Blockchain technology is essential in this project since everyone can check the unchangeability (trust) of the assessments. Also, Blockchain is a main transfer of value (reward) between the pool and a recipient. As Ethereum blockchain has limited throughput and a high cost for small transactions, we use side chain with high throughput, which is referenced to main blockchain (ethereum) in a way, that block-hash off side chain is reflected on the main blockchain, ensuring trust and unchangeability of the scores. Personal data is off-chain for obvious reasons.  I hope I made it clear for you but if you have any more questions feel free to ask.",False

I am just reading your whitepaper. One question occured to me during reading: You state that you want to reduce the amount of spam by offering you platform by only targeting users interested in your product. To add new customers to the list you suggest web marketing like Google Adwords. My perception is that you see this as a bad thing but you don't propose a solution.  Am I getting something wrong? Or: What is your plan to add new people to the interest-specific mailing lists? Thank you for your time!,False
