Because of the fact that masternode coins can utilize masternodes as opposed to full nodes, really stands out on its own. Low cost for hosting maternodes solves problems as it is generally known that this operations are not very cost efficient. It also brings masternode hosting closer to the users by simplifying everything rather than making it difficult, which is a big plus for me. It also has support for many different coins and is integrated with Bitcoin Lightning Network and Ethereum Raiden Network.
