Saturn Network successfully launched Radex Classic today bringing the first decentralized exchange to Ethereum Classic network. After releasing Saturn Wallet earlier this week, a wallet that supports accessing decentralized applications both on Ethereum and Ethereum Classic blockchains from your browser, team Saturn went one step further with migrating Radex over to the ETC chain.  Radex is a zero fees uncensorable decentralized exchange for trading Ethereum tokens, it is the only DEX that supports ERC20 & ERC223 tokens, in fact, it has a very unique architecture that allows it to run completely on chain removing any need of overhead costs or centralization concerns. And now that very same exchange has been deployed onto Ethereum Classic. This is a crucial milestone for the future of both Ethereum Classic and Saturn Network’s project, as it centers around building a whole ecosystem of decentralized exchanges across multiple blockchains, with the team showing this week that they are capable of producing real technology across Ethereum & Ethereum Classic.",False

Neural networks are basically unbiased analysts who don't eat and sleep - they monitor market activity 24/7 and they make predictions about what's going to happen in the future. Think how human traders work: they subscribe to signals, monitor the status of order book on a particular exchange (or multiple exchanges), they try to find patterns in these data and interpret it, and they make an investment decision. Neural networks do the same thing - except they don't have a ""favorite"" coin that they're biased towards. The way a neural network works is similar to how a human would:  a) make a prediction b) compare against test data. If it got the prediction right - get some reward, if it got the prediction wrong - modify its internal structure in order to not repeat the same mistake again c) repeat  Essentially learning from its own experience.  As of today, smart human traders, in my opinion, will still outperform available trading bots, but only because there's a shortage of available data to train the bots. This is why we're building a data aggregation platform first - it's all about the quality of the data. We will then train neural networks on our diverse data feeds, and will build tools that allow investors without a math PhD to build such AI assistants themselves and use this assistant in their trading strategies through signals. And once we implement stop-loss and other risk mitigating strategies we'll sell subscriptions to our trading bots on Rados.  In the near future we imagine humans and machines working hand in hand in the markets. Machines are now better than humans in detecting patterns in data and answering questions about what's likely to happen in the future given a specific question. But the humans have the creativity to ask the right questions and think strategically. Neural networks are simply a very powerful tool that lets traders focus more on the interesting part of the job, asking the right questions and discovering profitable strategies, while leaving the boring busywork of sifting through data to specialized AIs.",False

There are two ways to develop cryptocurrency projects: the Satoshi way and the Buterin way. The Satoshi way means build secure technology and get people's buy-in based on the technological superiority and respect for everyone's freedom and privacy. The Buterin way means lend your photo to any venture capital backed startup for a share of profits without actually contributing anything to the project, and bend over in front of any big money investor. While we appreciate what mr. Buterin is doing for cryptocurrency adoption, we strongly believe that the new decentralized economy should be built the Satoshi way. This way you'll actually care about the idea and how it works under the hood and not just play the reputation game.  The Pre-ICO will last for a whole month and we'll be regularly pushing updates to our blog and our website, so you'll be able to assess our competence based on what you see.

We plan to build the most comprehensive investor portal and empower our subscribers to make wise investment decisions.  Radex  Announcement! https://rados.io/posts/radex-alpha-is-live  Radex is a decentralized exchange for ethereum tokens. Radex is the first decentralized exchange for ERC223 tokens - a new token standard that has some advantages over conventional ERC20.  Radex is the first 0% fee decentralized exchange. It consists of two parts: a smart contract that handles all the financial transactions and the web application that makes interacting with the smart contract easier. The smart contract is well reviewed, tested, and most importantly open source. You can view the code for the smart contract on our Github. You can read more about its architecture and development philosophy here.  When we say 0% fee we mean that the exchange does not have an admin or another entity of authority that extracts rent from exchange ownership. However it’s worth noting that there are certain fees for every transaction that you send to Ethereum blockchain. These fees go to Ethereum miners that secure the blockchain for all of us. Keep reading to find out the full fee structure.  Community  If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.  We will actively engage with our community, collect feedback on our existing offerings and eliciting requirements for new tools and services. Every quarter we will release an updated roadmap proposal that our subscribers and investors can critique or endorse. Every roadmap proposal will be accompanied by a voting smart contract, ensuring transparency of Rados’s strategic decision making. At the end of the voting period top projects will be added to our roadmap.  Let’s work together to build the toolbox of a modern investor.

We're also working on a blog post that will shed some light on the platform's applications, stay tuned to that.     Rados is, technically, a traditional SaaS business when it comes to features. We will host the data processing pipeline and the data warehouse on google cloud platform because we believe that they have the best infrastructure primitives available compared to, say, AWS, and charge a better price. Namely, when it comes to data warehousing, https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/ blows the competition out of the water, and lets you query and analyze petabytes of data in a convenient format.  Access to some datasets will be restricted behind a paywall and you will be able to get access for a monthly subscription fee. The fee will be charged in Saturn, an Ethereum token that's an extension of the ERC20 standard. Cryptocurrencies have many redeeming qualities, but the one that got us excited for this project is the fact that you can treat smart contracts as programmable money. The goal is to use Saturn as the payment currency for Rados, and display the full history of rados.io's wallet transactions on the website. Think of a typical report that an internet company sends to its shareholders every quarter: revenue, total number of users, number of active users, average revenue per user, etc. etc. By utilizing Saturn's smart contract and our data processing tech we'll be able to update this report in real time.   Will all Eth wallet (MEW, Parity, etc) be able to interact with Rados to withdraw tokens?  Yes, Saturn lives in the Ethereum ecosystem and is compliant with ERC20 standard. So, on the very first day of the ICO, you can already store tokens on your desktop (say Mist), mobile (token.im) or hardware (Ledger Nano S) wallet, and you can trade it on ERC20 exchanges such as https://cryptoderivatives.market/ and https://etherdelta.github.io/#PLU-ETH. This ecosystem is one of the main reasons why we chose Ethereum over other platforms that offer token creation, despite all the hacks going on.  The good news is that all recent hacks are caused by negligence rather than exploiting a fault in ethereum's protocol. That's why we won't be releasing our smart contract until we can prove beyond reasonable doubt that all methods of interacting with it are secure.",False

We're definitely in it for the long run, and it goes without saying that you should invest your own money only when you yourself are comfortable doing so. Hopefully our answers to your questions and here and on our blog. In fact, as we speak I'm training a neural network for the second part of our AI trading blog series https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@rados/ai-powered-trading-part-i  This series of blog posts should give you an idea of what we think the future of trading will be. As more AI agents join the cryptocurrency market we should see less pump&dump strategies being executed on shitcoins daily and more stable exchange rates for cryptocurrencies across all exchanges, similar to what happened to stocks after high frequency trading became mainstream. Trading AIs need lots of high detail, high quality data that covers the whole cryptocurrency market for training that is simply currently unavailable, which is why our first product, Rados, is the data collection platform. And while there are hoards of other projects that promise similar things you will get a chance to see how we execute and what research we're doing and you'll decide for yourself which project to back.  As far as translations go, we will not be giving out tokens for this work because that's not the right way to attract devoted community leaders. However, if you truly believe in our project, feel free to blog about us and include your referral link in your blog post, which entitles you to 5% of STN tokens purchased by the people you invite. And we will be happy to publish the link to your blog on our website to help you promote your blog.",False
