The profiling of the gaming platform on mass games, for different audiences for even gambling players. In contrast to classic gambling sites and casinos, PlayBets team is striving to provide a high-quality catalog of mass online games supported and developed independently, providing a benchmark of quality for publishing games from third-party developers, based on a publishing model.

Developed internal jackpot system, between players and token holders is aiming to retain and stimulate the participation of each user and designed to strengthen the platform’s internal economy.  6. Blockchain integration of the Jackpots operation. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have unlocked new possibilities for security and honesty of games, and we use this, striving to create games, that are just simple for everyone. The technology of honest game results, based on an international encryption method, along with prize funds lotteries and Jackpots, based on blockchain technology, create new possibilities in gambling games.  7. Smart contract integration for: - input and output of funds in ETH and BTC; - checking the availability of tokens and participants tickets crediting from participants (jackpots drawing); - crediting of winning funds to the participant’s wallet (jackpots drawing).  8. Platform Tokens Ecosystem gives: - opportunities to play for Tokens and place bets; - participation in the Jackpots (weekly, monthly); - rotation on the Cryptocurrency slot exchanges.  9. Finished MVP platform version, with one of the games, with a daily growing audience. PlayBets is already an operating platform, with honest and open game results, high number of game sessions per day and growing audience. At the Pre-ICO and ICO stages, we are planning to publish a whole range of new games. We are aiming to develop and scale our gaming platform, during fees.  10. A proven and well-designed Business Model Gaming platform development and its growth prospects is conditioned by the business plan and metrics, based on the experience of the team and related gambling projects.  11. Ability to scale the platform, according to the White Label program. We are beginning to scale our gaming platform.

Also, because the skill gap between sharks and average players is so high, people play a few times and lose and never try again. My idea would be to combine competitive gaming with something that gives people attention that they want.

Thank you for good question It might be article for us - soon  1. Honesty. Provably Fair gambling. Cryptocurrencies are capturing the online gambling games market and becoming the most popular payment methods among gamblers. Until recently, only few game resources were accepting bitcoins, but today its integration into payment systems has become ubiquitous. Primarily, this is happening because of loyal control, compare to fiduciary funds for both market participants — players and online operators. Consequently, all transactions in our gambling platform are transparent and available for checking on the blockchain.  2. Multicurrency. Accepting bets for up to 20 different types of cryptocurrency. According to experts of the gambling games market, cryptocurrencies will take a leading position in the market and fulfill a key role in this sphere. Cryptocurrencies are becoming the most reliable, transparent and profitable distribution sphere for the online gambling games industry. We give you an opportunity to add funds in the most popular cryptocurrencies, such as: ETH, BTC, KICK, PLT, etc.  3. Unifying game platform.

Buy-Out system offers buying games from developers and collaborate with third-party game companies with the aim of expanding the game catalog. This means, that any game developer can develop a game that matches the description below and can sign a partnership contract.  4. Mass character. The profiling of the gaming platform on mass games, for different audiences for even gambling players. In contrast to classic gambling sites and casinos, PlayBets team is striving to provide a high-quality catalog of mass online games supported and developed independently, providing a benchmark of quality for publishing games from third-party developers, based on a publishing model. The game platform represents a game catalog with mass and alluring gambling games, where each user can choose a game to match their taste, and play without any limitations, with fast deposit and funds withdrawal, which were earned in cryptocurrency.  5. Internal Ecosystem,  in the form of global Jackpots, which are distributed among players, developers and holders of platform tokens (weekly and monthly). Developed internal jackpot system, between players and token holders is aiming to retain and stimulate the participation of each user and designed to strengthen the platform’s internal economy.  6. Blockchain integration of the Jackpots operation. Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have unlocked new possibilities for security and honesty of games, and we use this, striving to create games, that are just simple for everyone. The technology of honest game results, based on an international encryption method, along with prize funds lotteries and Jackpots, based on blockchain technology, create new possibilities in gambling games.  7. Smart contract integration for: - input and output of funds in ETH and BTC; - checking the availability of tokens and participants tickets crediting from participants (jackpots drawing); - crediting of winning funds to the participant’s wallet (jackpots drawing).  8. Platform Tokens Ecosystem gives: - opportunities to play for Tokens and place bets; - participation in the Jackpots (weekly, monthly); - rotation on the Cryptocurrency slot exchanges.  9. Finished MVP platform version, with one of the games, with a daily growing audience. PlayBets is already an operating platform, with honest and open game results, high number of game sessions per day and growing audience. At the Pre-ICO and ICO stages, we are planning to publish a whole range of new games. We are aiming to develop and scale our gaming platform, during fees.  10. A proven and well-designed Business Model Gaming platform development and its growth prospects is conditioned by the business plan and metrics, based on the experience of the team and related gambling projects.  11. Ability to scale the platform, according to the White Label program. We are beginning to scale our gaming platform.

The PLT PlayBets token provides the right to be a full-fledged participant in the platform’s ecosystem with all attached preferences, to exchange it for in-game currency, participate in regular  distributed weekly and monthly jackpots, exchange and list on key cryptocurrency exchanges In summary, PLT Tokens provide the ability to  •   Participation in drawing weekly jackpot lottery (10% of platform revenue) •   Participation in drawing exclusive monthly jackpot lottery (10% of revenue) •   Opportunity to exchange and to list on key cryptocurrency platforms"" •   Use as a game currency on the PlayBets platform  Why will the price of your PLT token grow?   (taken from website FAQ) Potential growth may be provided by increasing the size of the platform’s audience,  and as a result of Jackpot lotteries between players and Token owners. In other words, the more people are connected to the PlayBets game platform, the greater the turnover of PLT tokens, PlayBets Coins and Jackpots, which will speak to the possible increase in the company’s income and influence the growth of the PLT token.  Important: we can’t guarantee token growth for a range of reasons, its purchase is not an investment.  It is also important to note that it is exclusively a Utility token, used directly for the use of services within the game platform.  So do not take it as a method of passive income",False
