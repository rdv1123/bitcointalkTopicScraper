If you are an eSports player, you can use the eSports platform to take part in matches and tournaments of games such as League of Legends, FIFA 17, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds and Halo, among many others that will be added over time.  If you prefer to place bets on: events or tournaments, eSports, sports, casino games, or games of chance, then can sign into the betting platform, casino, or lottery developed specifically for this specific client profile.    Security and Smart Contracts  These two concepts are the foundation of the change that we at AstorGame are planning for the gaming and betting sector. At all times, the funds paid in by AstorGame’s players will be protected by a smart contract, which is to say that if there are, between players and bettors, ten thousand users on the web platform and it is attacked or, for some reason, goes offline, the funds will automatically be returned to their respective owners by means of the smart contracts.  The platform will enable entries to be recorded on a blockchain and allow for the utilization of intelligent contracts to manage the logic of the business, schedule prize payments, collect payments for tickets, bets, and drawings, and schedule tournaments and outcomes. All of this data is public and can be verified at any time.   Provably Fair  Casino bettors and lottery players have often felt unsure about whether the house was cheating them by manipulating the outcome. At AstorGame, we use various technologies to solve this problem. One of these, Provably Fair, enables the client to verify that each game played follows the rules and that values have not been changed by a third party in order to put them at a disadvantage.  Currently, encryption technologies are a big help in coding a string of values, be they numbers, text, or alphanumeric, thus preventing anyone from “cracking” the outcome and changing it. An encrypted value will be acquired from the user’s browser that will not be known to AstorGame’s server.   Smart Contracts + Provably Fair  It is possible that Provably Fair is already being used in some online casinos, but no online casino offers both of these applied technologies on the same platform. The use of Provably Fair and CSRNG, which generates numbers randomly, does not guarantee that a casino will deliver the prizes in a legal manner or that the funds corresponding to this pot will not disappear. It is here that smart contracts become more important, since they can be programmed so that the pot of a bet will be retained until it is known whether the user has won the bet. If the user wins, there is no way for the owner of the casino to keep the pot or to delay payment, as happens in many gambling houses, That’s why we at AstorGame are the first to combine both platforms for the benefit of our clients.   Goal      To become, within a period of 10 years, a leading online gaming company on the global market.  Objectives  To offer a variety of games in different categories to secure the inflow of a variety of client profiles To develop to the fullest extent each of the gaming sectors in which AstorGame will participate To promote AstorGame on a global level, setting ourselves apart through the use of new technologies, customer service, and the freshness of our games To offer efficiency, speed, security and transparency to all of our clients To expand the market, offering free courses for bettors on other shared platforms so that they might understand how the use of technologies like blockchain and smart contracts benefit them  Online Gaming Platforms  eSports games and tournaments eSports betting (including the capacity for ""live betting"") Sports betting (including the capacity for ""live betting"") Casino games Lotteries     Token details A total of 100,000,000 Astor tokens will be issued without any additional tokens.

How do you reach the public and show you the benefits of a new product? delivering demonstrations to test the product, approaching the customer further from the screen of a monitor, instructing them in this new technology, eSports, for example, is a large market of very young people who perform a sport, here they are not only bets or casino games, eSports players are athletes, astorgame not only based on the online platforms, events are also planned in physical places in the future, that's what our main strategy is about getting closer to the public, not waiting for the public to come to us in cyberspace  I hope that my words also serve those projects that were launched or are being launched at this moment, projects are made to attract people, and there are few who come to the real world, beyond cyberspace and show how it is used and the benefits of using these platforms that is why companies like Microsoft became the companies that they are today, because they also have a novel product, they approached the public, in every house there is a windows system even for those who use linux at some point in their lives they must interact with a system using  Microsoft product, they have in their online platforms completely free courses in addition to events that take place around the world constantly and since its inception We could also talk about companies like Oracle, Facebook, Yahoo or Google among the best known.   I can not reveal all our marketing plan and future plans because it can use another company of the competition and as we know it is not very positive for a business if this happens.  about how to protect ourselves from cheaters we have several options, for now we have our attention on a client that offers ESEA for games like counter strike, this while we finish developing our own anti-cheat software  I hope everybody can understand my english language   and hope also that your question has the answer that you expect, anyway... everybody  can contact me in linkedin or facebook there is the link in www.astorgame.com  or email  to info@astorgame.com can also feel free write to my personal email paulmx77@hotmail.com",False
