Well performing tokens will have option to get listed on Ecex Exchange. At the beginning functionality is available for Ethereum based tokens ERC20/ERC223, later Stellar assets will follow.

For many companies, utility appears to be an afterthought, but for a token to be successfully adopted into the community, it is the most critical component. With the amount of tokens on the market today, and new ones being launched every day, it’s clear there is a bubble, though the size of it might be debatable.” https://www.coindesk.com/defining-word-tokens-2018/  Shawn Wilkinson from Coindesk argued 3 ways companies have to create they utility Tokens and we tried to connect dots  and show that our Ziggurat Token is 100% utility Tokens.  The first argument is about purchasing services. PlanetZiggurat issued tokens mainly for two reasons. First is about collecting financing for future development and second is to find useful way connect service buyers to our Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform. „Purchasing services with tokens accelerates the time it takes for a transaction to settle, it makes purchasing services easier and adds an element of privacy as well. In the beginning, when the company is scaling and spending more money than they are making, the volume of tokens exchanged for the purchase of services will be minimal, but as the company’s revenues grow, so will the token transfer rate. You don’t need to require tokens to purchase services, but providing the option (and possibly providing a discount for doing so) can go a long way in driving the use of your token.”  The second argument is about the create a self-sustainable ecosystem. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is developed exactly for solutions like using utility Tokens. Trading Platform is using ethereum smart contract solutions, allowed client make transactions with different money and coin solutions ethereum, bitcoin and free market Tokens included. We will create a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, facilitating transactions utilizing Ziggurat token and we create a self-sustaining ecosystem that is based on transacting our Ziggurat token.  The third argument is about automated smart contract payments. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform will definitely use smart contract but our first option is to use them to approve contracts. There will be several NDA agreements what have to be approved besides the main assignment agreement contract and ethereum smart contract solution giving us that possibility. We do not rule out automated smart contract payments entirely, but our business model fundamental agreement take place between our client and we have only advisable and deliberative role. Automated payments capabilities can be used on our Trading Platform regarding trading service fees and on same side-products as phone payments or wallet services.   The conclusion is that Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform Ziggurat Tokens fit well into the definition of the utility token.",False

Trading will be stopped for this day and all open orders will be closed.  Token swap ration is 1/4 . In general contract swap with changing the total supply of tokens or not compensating all tokens will lead automatic delisting from Ecex Exchange.

So, in this case, we will make an exception. Delisting would lead to total loss of assets and seems like the worse option for investors.

The assignments exchange need for work not only perfect code and reflection on the global markets but every level player, who are willing to make unusual deals with the different class of assets. These persons are the souls of the business and they have the crucial role in the start of the business. We all know the saying that who is the first client. Ourselves of course. But who is the second? If the second client coming there are only two problems left, raise the number of clients and keep tabs on the quality of your product. At the moment Ecex.Exchange token trading entity works well, we have over 100 listing, 20  on the waiting list, we have approximately 3500 trades per day and the record day by eth turnover is 100 eth. Tokens trading actors are investors and behind the curtain the token emitters, developers. There are some definitions before we can go further:  What is a 'Creditor' and How Creditors Make Money A creditor is an entity (person or institution) that extends credit by giving another entity permission to borrow money intended to be repaid in the future. A business who provides supplies or services to a company or an individual and does not demand payment immediately is also considered a creditor, based on the fact that the client owes the business money for services already rendered. Creditors can be classified as either personal or real. People who loan money to friends or family are personal creditors. Real creditors such as banks or finance companies have legal contracts with the borrower, sometimes granting the lender the right to claim any of the debtor's real assets (e.g. real estate or cars) if he fails to pay back the loan. Simply, creditors make money by charging interest on the loans they offer their clients. For example, if a creditor lends a borrower $5,000 with a 5% interest rate, the lender makes money due to the interest on the loan. In turn, the creditor accepts a degree of risk that the borrower may not repay the loan. To mitigate risk, most creditors index their interest rates or fees to the borrower's creditworthiness and past credit history. Thus, being a responsible borrower could save you a substantial sum, particularly if you are taking out a large loan, like a mortgage. Interest rates for mortgages vary based on a myriad of factors, including the size of the down payment and the lender itself; however, one's creditworthiness has a primary impact on one's interest rate.  Assignment Long story short creditor is the owner of rights and these rights are on a form of written contract. This written contract is the object of the next contract – assignment.     Contract assignment. A contract assignment means that a party to the contract assigns the entire contract to another party. This means that the party gives the obligations and benefits of an existing contract to another party. This situation occurs when a party to a contract wants another party to completely step in and fulfill the contract. The ability to assign a contract to another party is a fairly common practice in contracts law. This type of assignment is common in a wide variety of different contract situations.  Assignment of Rights There is also a second type of assignment. Sometimes, an assignor will only make an assignment of rights. This means that the original party remains obligated to fulfill the contract, but another party receives the contractual benefits.   Assignor and Assignee An assignor can be an individual, a group, or a business. The assignor is the party that transfers its contractual rights to another party. In a contract assignment, this means that the party transfers both the contractual obligations and the contractual benefits. In an assignment of rights, this means that the party transfers just the benefit of the contract. The assignee is the party that receives the rights and obligations under the contract but wasn't an original party to the contract. Usually, an assignee receives the contract rights and obligations directly from an original party to the contract.  Obligor and Obligee An obligor is a party that is obligated to do something under the terms of a contract. You will sometimes hear the term 'obligor' used to describe a 'borrower' or a 'debtor.' This is common because many contracts are debt contracts, but it's important to note that obligors can be required to do something other than repaying debt. Obligors can be obligated to perform a particular task or even to refrain from a particular activity. Whenever we have an assignment and an obligor, we'll have an obligee.  Real Life On the Ecex.Exchange assignment market the user have to detect what role he or she can play. There are different possibilities to make money and different products which can be useful in several life situations. If you have some claims against your neighbors you can sell the claims, if you have an open agreement about selling your work or product you have easy possibilities to refinance your investment to this project. If you need a loan, you can sell a loan agreement against yourself.  Token trading + Assignment trading = Ecex.Exchange Token trading participants are the first ones who can emit the first assignments and will trade them. We open trading for assignments the very same ecosystem there token trading occur today. This is the way we try to accustom the future assignment traders. Assignments trading is a very new idea and the trading instruments are new and in the start trading need lot of support and development not only from management side but from the custom side as well.

Stephen Hawking liked to talk to his students about big bang theory. This is an idea about starting the universe and about galaxies, how they expand, moved away from each other and what happened after the big bang. But in his mind, nothing was before the big bang and nobody talk about it or assume that might it be. As far as we concerned, events before the big bang can have no concequences.  But before blockchain was 3000 years, starting from the market in ancient Rome business as usual. There was paterfamilias, libre and mancipatio, legal entities and mutual agreements. And we all know how to operate this world.  After the blockchains related tokens presented, usual business start in some sense, in some areas or venues little bit crack.  There are several issues, but today I want to talk about Naked tokens. The name is my idea and it characterized very well widely released smart contracts without the team, company, token agreement, whitepaper, address, country and even developer.  We all know classic token ICO ordinance. We can monitor ICOs on several web services and make decisions relay on presented data. Everybody can check background, who team members are, call and write them, talk about the project on the forums and so on. After ICO most of the projects try to list on marketplaces and wide userbase can trade the tokens openly.  And yes there is another possibility to release tokens. The token is the only smart contract. In Ethereum Blockchain case we monitor token on the Etherscan.io. There is a number of tokens, decimals, and other significant info.  Naked token work with minimal info. Mostly the only number of tokens, the name of tokens, decimals. No links, no webpage address. And some cases there is the same name two or even three contract in same name and number of tokens. Naked token open Twitter page, it is not rare when they buy some old Twitter feed with some 5000 followers.  And of course webpage, there is no email address, team, country.  As we all know the most important document is the token contract, agreement, usage agreement… This looks like tabu for several real token ICOs and Naked token people probably do not know that this token agreement is.  The first expression is that it cant be the legal business and there are no good possibilities to the Naked token to try to attract funds.  But developers (persons behind) Naked tokens try to list their tokens to the tokens exchanges. It means that they try to fund through the selling tokens on markets not using ICO ordinance.  Still. There might be teams, who release Naked token with good will. Maybe they learn during the process, they produce whitepaper, draft exceptional token agreement, present product, repair they etherscan.io links, find and collect exemplary social followers, list Naked tokens on the exchanges and will that way fund development.   The dilemma occurs then Naked token fill application for listing. It is impossible to predict who is who. One and the most important thing that asks from the Naked token is a key person full KYC process. The second thing is the price. The naked token has to pay for the higher risk. And third is the subjective assessment by the evaluator to a particular idea.    Let's leave this market to decide what a good project is and what not. Projects, different tokens or coins listed can develop and succeed in time. If the project is poor then its price will fall and enterprise will end his existence. The laws of nature are also valid on the crypto world.     Tallinn 2nd of September    Tõnis Hilep CEO PlanetZiggurat OÜ +3725078332 skype: tonis.hilep info@ecex.exchange ",False

Our original whitepaper is written form the assignment point of view, but on the way, we decided to make an adventure to ethereum blockchain smart contract ecosystem.  Reason derives from our thoughts that cryptocurrency can be a big help to our customers and the assignment owners can use blockchain and cryptocurrency exchange to their needs. It is not a big secret, that cryptocurrencies have not a real outlet. Where are no enough places except exchanges where you can use crypto? So we try to solve problems for crypto as well.We are open to anyone interested in the early stages of  listing or airdrop.  Our main incentive remains assignment exchange. Assignments possible turnover probably exceed crypto several times. And our emphasis remains on assignments.  But. But cryptocurrencies flourish at the moment and we develop our crypto section first. Today we have already open several testing pairs (98) and  Ecex.Exchange Ethereum turnover over 12-47eth per day. There are some 60 different tokens waiting for listing and airdrop on our Ecex.Exchange. Tokens used our ecosystem to make airdrop to our 58000 users/customers. We received a positive response from our social channels as Telegram, Twitter, and Facebook. We are going to develop Ecex.Exchange to simple, transparent and secure exchange. Multinational as well. But everything takes time.  Our Ziggurat token is listed on ForkDelta, EtherDelta and Token.Store. We submitted applications on several exchanges and waiting responds. We remind our customers that every development and business that PlanetZiggurat OÜ plans are long-term and reasonable. Developers are not looking for quick profits and do not make any strides in their tokens in the short term. So, be patience.  During the next two months, we improve the Ecex.Exchange and start looking for bigger listing partners and we will try to find airdrop partners as well. (for some reason all love airdrops)  Ecex Exchange has made a strategic decision to integrate with Stellar blockchain. The first step will be for Ecex to list Lumen (XLM). This opens the door to the second step of all Stellar tokens and assets. We already have contacts from teams who are interested in listing and airdropping Stellar based tokens. This will be the beginning of Ecex Exchange expanding from single blockchain assets to a multi-blockchain assets trading platform. Stellar is particularly interesting because of the financial targeting, speed, and low transaction costs. Also, its approach to solving real-life financial tasks such as bridging systems and multi-signatures. Handling different types of assets are especially important for business as Ecex Exchange develops. PlanetZiggurat OÜ received two licenses for Ecex.Exchange platform: FVR000341 Providing services of exchanging a virtual currency against fiat currency FRK00281 Providing a virtual currency wallet services  We looking for fiat trading for institutional clients starting from 1st of October 2018.

But the market wants different opportunities. We need to develop and give the market what they want.",False

There is always imaginations and visions which move our practice. Our original whitepaper is written form the assignment point of view, but on the way, we decided to make an adventure to ethereum blockchain smart contract ecosystem.  Reason derives from our thoughts that cryptocurrency can be a big help to our customers and the assignment owners can use blockchain and cryptocurrency exchange to their needs. It is not a big secret, that cryptocurrencies have not a real outlet. Where are no enough places except exchanges where you can use crypto? So we try to solve problems for crypto as well.We are open to anyone interested in the early stages of  listing or airdrop.  Our main incentive remains assignment exchange. Assignments possible turnover probably exceed crypto several times. And our emphasis remains on assignments.  But cryptocurrencies flourish at the moment and we develop our crypto section first. Today we have already open several testing pairs (50) and ZIG/ETH pair have made first 1M  ZIG turnover. There are some 25 different tokens waiting for listing and airdrop on our Ecex.Exchange. Tokens used our ecosystem to make airdrop to our 40000 users/customers. We received a positive response from our social channels as Telegram, Twitter, and Facebook. We are going to develop Ecex.Exchange to simple, transparentand secure exchange. Multinational as well. But everything takes time.  Our Ziggurat token is listed on FrokDelta, EtherDelta and Token.Store. We submitted applications on several exchanges and waiting responds. We remind our customers that every development and business that PlanetZiggurat OÜ plans are long-term and reasonable. Developers are not looking for quick profits and do not make any strides in their tokens in the short term. So, be patience.   During next two months, we improve the Ecex.Exchange and start looking for bigger listing partners and we will try to find airdrop partners as well. (for some reason all love airdrops)    Cryptoworld looking for solutions to use cryptocurrencies. There will be no easy and fast solutions and the market will be under the development next 20 or 200 years. But the market wants different opportunities. We need to develop and give the market what they want.   https://ecex.exchange/",False

The issue is well described in this article https://stocksgazette.com/2018/07/03/ethereum-eth-network-experiences- congestions-gas-price-rises/ Ecex Exchange is no exception in this matter. Technically speaking the network situation is not an issue, at least not the huge one. The issue is that we want to offer best-priced services to our customers and with the current situation, it creates big delays. How will Ecex Exchange address this matter? We will restructure and redesign our withdrawal engine. Fees options will be changed and rephrased: A) I want my assets now (10-20 minutes) B) I want it in 24h with more reasonable fee price. C) Speed is not an issue, make it cheaper (might take 1-3 days). Fees pricing model will be changed: a) Fees will be dynamic and be changing by Ethereum network gas price. b) Fees for different tokens will be different according to the gas limit they need for transfer. c) ZIG transaction fee (where available) will be 75% of ETH transaction fee on the base of current lowest sale offer. What will ZIG new transaction fees model give? 1) It will make more publicity to ZIG token. 2) It will rise ZIG token trading volume. 3) It will make ZIG token price and actual transaction fee more transparent. 4) When ZIG price rises the fee nominal price automatically lowers.       Security  As a security measure, every customer can make one automatic withdrawal per 24 h. Next withdrawals will require supervisor’s manual approval. Also, for every token certain maximum automatic limits are set. Depending on customer’s history both limits can be raised. Supervising usually takes place in business hours 6:00 AM UTC to 8:00 PM UTC. If possible Ecex Exchange will extend those hours. In case of an anomaly in price fluctuations withdrawal can be suspended if needed.  Maintenance  As you might have seen we have daily maintenance break from 8:00 PM UTC to 8:15 PM.UTC. 8:00 PM UTC is considered as trading day end for Ecex Exchange. This will also allow us to implement one day orders what will be flushed after trading day end if not fully executed before. When will this take place? It is planned to take place step-by-step latest in the second week of July.  Ecex Exchange",False

There is always imaginations and visions which move our practice.  Our original whitepaper is written form the assignment point of view, but on the way, we decided to make an adventure to ethereum blockchain smart contract ecosystem.  Reason derives from our thoughts that cryptocurrency can be a big help to our customers and the assignment owners can use blockchain and cryptocurrency exchange to their needs. It is not a big secret, that cryptocurrencies have not a real outlet. Where are no enough places except exchanges where you can use crypto? So we try to solve problems for crypto as well.We are open to anyone interested in the early stages of  listing or airdrop.  Our main incentive remains assignment exchange. Assignments possible turnover probably exceed crypto several times. And our emphasis remains on assignments.  But. But cryptocurrencies flourish at the moment and we develop our crypto section first. Today we have already open several testing pairs and ZIG/BTK pair have made first 100k BTK turnover. There are some 25 different tokens waiting for listing on our Ecex.Exchange. Bitcoin Token used our ecosystem to make airdrop to our 15500 users/customers. We received a positive response from our social channels as Telegram, Twitter, and Facebook. We are going to develop Ecex.Exchange to simple, transparent and secure exchange. Multinational as well. But everything takes time.  Our Ziggurat token is listed on FrokDelta, EtherDelta and Token.Store. We submitted applications on several exchanges and waiting responds. We remind our customers that every development and business that PlanetZiggurat OÜ plans are long-term and reasonable. Developers are not looking for quick profits and do not make any strides in their tokens in the short term. So, be patience.  During next two months, we improve the Ecex.Exchange and start looking for bigger listing partners and we will try to find airdrop partners as well. (for some reason all love airdrops)     Cryptoworld looking for solutions to use cryptocurrencies. There will be no easy and fast solutions and the market will be under the development next 20 or 200 years. But the market wants different opportunities. We need to develop and give the market what they want.",False

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF ASSIGNMENT  1.1.Roman Law  The Roman law provides an invaluable introduction to the understanding of legal concepts and a passport to the appreciation of Continental legal systems. Roman law is the product of the genius of good order and organized common sense of a remarkable ancient civilization, and it constitutes a legacy that has had a profound influence in subsequent ages.   1.2. Cessio   There are  two main institutes related to cessio:   - cessio bonorum: where a debtor had become insolvent owing to unforeseen circumstances, he could, under the formulary procedure, avoid the infamy attached to execution by petitioning a magistrate to allow him to make a voluntary cession of his property (cessio bonorum) to his creditors;  - cessio in iure: Litt. cession before a court. It was a ritual procedure (imitating the procedure of the legis actio sacramento in rem) already known by the time of the Twelve Tables that was used to create, transfer or extinguish certain rights (specifically the so-called ?Quiritary rights?). It partly fell into disuse in classical Roman law.1.  Cessio bonorum, (Latin: ?a cession of goods?), a voluntary surrender of goods by a debtor to his creditors. It did not amount to a discharge of the debt unless the property ceded was sufficient for the purpose, but it secured the debtor from personal arrest. The creditors sold the goods, applying the proceeds to their claims. Although property that the debtor might acquire later could be claimed by the creditors, he could not be deprived of the bare necessities. The main features of cessio bonorum were adopted into the French and other legal systems. In England it survives in the internal regulations of certain commercial bodies, such as stock exchanges. Cessio bonorum ,was a procedure introduced by Augustus reign (Republic) , whereby a judgement debtor voluntarily surrendered his property to the creditors. The property was sold off, but the debtor would not be subjected to legal disgrace or to the possible imprisonment by the creditors. Surrender was not available as of the right: it applied only there the preator was satisfied that the debtor had genuine assets and that the bankruptcy was the result of misfortune.  In jure cessio was a conveyance in the form of a lawsuit. The transferee claimed before the magistrate that the thing was his, and the transferor, who was the defendant, admitted the claim. The magistrate then adjudged the thing to the transferee. (The sham-lawsuit theory, however, is not acceptable to all modern scholars, principally because the judgment of ownership was valid against any possible private claimant, not merely against the defendant, as in a true lawsuit.) 2 Cessio had some similarities to mancipatio. It was a highly formal and cumbersome conveyance, originating before the Twelve Tables and fading in importance long before Justinian. Our knowledge of cessio is derived mainly from Gaius, who tells us(Inst.Gai.2.24) that cessio was performed before a magistrate, such as the preator(or governor) with the transferor and transferee present, together with the property to be transferred (or a symbolic sod of earth in the case of land). The transferee grasped the property and uttered the same set words as in mancipatio. The preator asked the transferor thether he claimed the thing. Assuming that the latter stayed silent, or made no claim, he was taken as having ceded his rights, whereupon the preator awarded the property to the transferee.3  2. ASSIGNMENT  TODAY  An assignment (Latin cessio) is a term used with similar meanings in the law of contracts and in the law of real estate. In both instances, it encompasses the transfer of rights held by one party?the assignor?to another party?the assignee. It can also be a transfer of a benefit, including an equitable interest, according to established rules (at common law or in equity).The rights may be vested or contingent.The details of the assignment determine some additional rights and liabilities (or duties). Typically a third-party is involved in a contract with the assignor, and the contract is in effect transferred to the assignee. For example, a borrower borrows money from a local bank. The local bank receives a mortgage note and can thereafter transfer that note to a financial institution in exchange for a lump-sum of cash, thereby assigning the right to receive payment from the borrower to another entity. Mortgages and lending contracts are relatively amenable to assignment since the lender's duties are relatively limited; other contracts which involve personal duties such as legal counsel may not be assignable. The assignment might be claims, all kind of contracts, factoring contracts, receivables, the pool of loan contracts and so on. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform enables download all assignment related documents to the digital container under digital signature. It mean if assignment agreement is on the market buyer obtain all related documents and have full authority to realize his rights.

For many companies, utility appears to be an afterthought, but for a token to be successfully adopted into the community, it is the most critical component. With the amount of tokens on the market today, and new ones being launched every day, it’s clear there is a bubble, though the size of it might be debatable.” https://www.coindesk.com/defining-word-tokens-2018/  Shawn Wilkinson from Coindesk argued 3 ways companies have to create they utility Tokens and we tried to connect dots  and show that our Ziggurat Token is 100% utility Tokens.  The first argument is about purchasing services. PlanetZiggurat issued tokens mainly for two reasons. First is about collecting financing for future development and second is to find useful way connect service buyers to our Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform. „Purchasing services with tokens accelerates the time it takes for a transaction to settle, it makes purchasing services easier and adds an element of privacy as well. In the beginning, when the company is scaling and spending more money than they are making, the volume of tokens exchanged for the purchase of services will be minimal, but as the company’s revenues grow, so will the token transfer rate. You don’t need to require tokens to purchase services, but providing the option (and possibly providing a discount for doing so) can go a long way in driving the use of your token.”  The second argument is about the create a self-sustainable ecosystem. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is developed exactly for solutions like using utility Tokens. Trading Platform is using ethereum smart contract solutions, allowed client make transactions with different money and coin solutions ethereum, bitcoin and free market Tokens included. We will create a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, facilitating transactions utilizing Ziggurat token and we create a self-sustaining ecosystem that is based on transacting our Ziggurat token.  The third argument is about automated smart contract payments. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform will definitely use smart contract but our first option is to use them to approve contracts. There will be several NDA agreements what have to be approved besides the main assignment agreement contract and ethereum smart contract solution giving us that possibility. We do not rule out automated smart contract payments entirely, but our business model fundamental agreement take place between our client and we have only advisable and deliberative role. Automated payments capabilities can be used on our Trading Platform regarding trading service fees and on some side-products as phone payments or wallet services.   The conclusion is that Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform Ziggurat Tokens fit well into the definition of the utility token.",False

EETP users will be very different economic agents who willing to perform the very different set of agreements. EETP blueprints show us, trading systems are meant for various universal agreements based on assignments from antic cession agreement logic and that there are possibilities to use EETP that all future exploitation is impossible to present. Here is little overview and examples what private person and companies can do with EETP.  1.Private person.  The simplest problem for the private person is personal loans and loan agreement.  Assume that Private Person wants to take a loan 5000 euros. The easiest use is to sell loan agreement against her/himself on EETP. It means loan buyer is lender and lender can bee assignor and sell loan forward trough stock like bid/ask system. Byer is assignee and Private person loan is on a free market. Everybody can buy it through EETP.  A private person can, of course, be assignor and sell all her/his assignments on EETP. The process is very simple.Private person log to EETP, there will be Jumio like identification, after that  she/he downloading all assignment related documents to digital container, read NDA and assignment agreement, put the price to assignment and after the submitting data the assignment is on EETP and  Private person role is assignor and her/his assignment is on market.    A private person can as assignee to find the financier for temporary bills or other loan agreements that she/he have to pay. Adding documents to assignment digital container and put the price Privat person can sell all different obligations she/he owns.   2. Company  Mostly same thing as the private person: Then about possibilities, then the company can sell loans and banks and credit companies have to buy them through simple assignment agreements. Keep in mind that loan agreements and other related documents are in the digital container and belong to assignment agreement. Assignee determines the provisions and assignor have to agree if assignor wants to buy and all this takes place in the marketplace, there mostly the same picture as stock market only instruments are assignments.  3. Financial institutions.  Let say that Italia gets busted. There are a hundred banks, wanting to sell the loan agreements and the only way is by phone to find the old classmate in China and try to pitch the quality of distress loan portfolio. EETP have the solution. Italian bank can but as assignor all loans to one digital container and spread the selling information through EETP to possible buyers and even give in ask side indicative offer. And maybe there will be in ten minutes the deal and the unknown for Italian bank manager Soul credit company bought all loans.",False

Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, NPSs, banks.  Currently, world markets for distressed debt tend to be characterized by comparatively small trade volumes, a limited number of active investors and large bid-ask spreads. This might reflect various factors, such as significant differences in the required rates of return for banks and investors and in loan recovery expectations, and how servicing costs are taken into account. Ecex.Exchange understand how this market currently functions and gather information how could assist its further development. In particular, it is of interest to ascertain if there are specific the gap to fill that constrain the assignment of loans.(Ecex.Exchange expertise) The lack of independent servicing capacity in some markets may hinder the development of liquid secondary markets for loans and especially distressed debt. That kind of independent services Ecex.Exchange exactly propose. Furthermore, when banks and credit companies assign defaulted loans, third-party servicers as Ecex.Exchange  represents an alternative to manage those loans on behalf of investors, which usually do not have appropriate capacity to service NPLs.   2. Assignment of loans  Banks may assign performing or non-performing loans to outside investors in order to manage the composition of their balance sheet, their risks and to allow a potential business model re-orientation. Loan contracts can, in principle, be assigned from the originating creditor to a third-party investor under private law regimes. This is most often done via an assignment agreement with the new creditor, which takes over the original creditor's rights and obligations. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is meant exactly for that kind of business.Banks will introduce NPLs on our platform and potential assignees will obtain the rights trough assignment agreement. Sales can contribute to strengthening banks’ balance sheets and their profitability in the medium to long-term, as the transferring bank would not incur the additional administrative expenses and potential additional losses related to the future management of the loans. In addition, removing NPLs from a bank's balance sheet reduces the uncertainty around the bank's asset quality and loan valuations, as uncertainty on possible future losses associated with the NPL portfolio disappears. In the short term, however, the assignment of NPLs might in some cases stress the bank's capital position and raise concerns regarding the viability of the bank. In some cases, assignee of NPL contracts, including non-banks, may be more effective in recovering value, in particular through the potential use of better management and servicing. Especially some smaller banks may lack the required in-house capacities and internal processes to manage large portfolios of non-performing loans. Moreover, banks and non-bank investors may face a different set of incentives and constraints when managing loans. Banks may be more reluctant to restructure loans to avoid moral hazard and so-called strategic defaults of existing borrowers. Today an important aspect of the functioning of secondary markets for NPLs are the large bid-ask spreads. Ecex.Exchange will reduce spreads and it decreases uncertainties about future cash flows, information asymmetries between assignors and assignees and also first-mover disadvantages/ coordination challenges. Together, these factors may significantly constrain the price discovery process. Potential assignees tend not to have access to reliable, granular, readily available standardized information on asset quality and loan tapes in banks. As a consequence, potential assignees may in some cases offer a price that does not reflect the value of portfolios for sale, thus hindering potential transactions.However, Ecex.Exchange provides stock market like price possibilities and assignors and assignees will present they best prices and wills and it is nature of the business that at some point prices are suitable for both parties.     3.Ziggurat Tokens    https://ecex.exchange  Ziggurat tokens shall provide for the user, today's case the banks, opportunities to sell and buy assignments (NPLs) for certain prices. There is the example: All service fees are for Ziggurat Token holders payable with Ziggurat Tokens. Let assume that assignment cost is 20 EUR. Ziggurat Tokens holder will pay 20 Ziggurats. Let assume that guest service fee is 50 EUR.Ziggurat Tokens holder will pay 50 Ziggurats. For paying for Exec.Exchange Trading Platform services Ziggurat Tokens can be used on exchange rate 1 ZIG  = 1 USD (this rate only Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform if paying for services.). We project our assignments amount several million, in the end, third year. It gives great opportunity trade tokens in free marketplaces or uses them on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform.The Ziggurat Tokens will be an integral part of the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform as a means to support and pay for the services on the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform.",False

Receivables market is mostly human trading. Electronic trading platforms for receivables, like stock exchanges, do not exist. There are some entrepreneurs and startups, the trading platforms are eBay-like online invoice trading and human-backed excel-based systems. There are no direct connections to investors. PlanetZiggurat goal is to bring assignments on Ecex.Exchange trading platform. We will fill the gap by creating a market environment, a system for an active trading platform of assignment agreements. This means changing for owners of a multitude of agreements and documents, such as claims, invoices and factoring agreements etc. The market system will be similar to the stock market – very transparent and fast and it will allow trading claims, invoices from the moment they are being issued until the payment date. Claims, invoices will be traded until the obligations are either met or erased due to bankruptcy or natural end of the issuer. The owner of the invoice or claim can delist his right any moment (and exercise his right to realize their own requirements). As all traders know, all markets function through leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. All traders want to be close to possibilities that allow them to make fast decisions and take actions directly, using market data and trading terminals. PlanetZiggurat will spread all relevant trading data to leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. We will make arrangements that will get the existing investor community connected to the new assignment market. Blockchain technology can be used to verify transactions using a third party. There are three tools planned: 1. The trading platform, exchange for claims, invoices and others subjects for assignments (all together assignments) 2. Exchange information flow through leading brokerage community. PlanetZiggurat will launch a trading platform to show and teach members and clients, https://ecex.exchange/  and https://planetziggurat.com/ 3. Blockchain, especially digital signature (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/)  PlanetZiggurat will start on the Estonian market due to the small size of the country as a test market and relatively high level of IT development in the country. This will allow to get a functional system up an running fast, have the system compatible with EU regulations and use a small market as a test site for further development in order to be able upscale in full range and functionality at bigger markets at the right time The stock exchange in Estonia is very small. There are 50 000 trades per year, the depository and market systems are designed for small volumes and are relatively cheap. PlanetZiggurat knows the involved persons and companies and is planning to build its systems with the same software and legal background. http://www.nasdaqbaltic.com/market/?lang=en PlanetZigurrat has an arrangement with an advisory company (http://bda.ee/en/) who will help to harmonize the system with legislation. This business plan, PlanetZiggurat OÜ Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform whitepaper, attempts to fill the gap described by European Commission Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union “DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY MARKETS FOR NON-PERFORMING LOANS AND DISTRESSED ASSETS AND PROTECTION OF SECURED CREDITORS FROM BORROWERS’ DEFAULT “ https://ico.ecex.exchange/",False

For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for €100, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.  Let's take the step further. Assume that Party C put the obligation on the Party B to Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and he/she want this obligation sell and price is €50. He/She log in and put the asking price to €50 and sent the notification to other parties and the market that he or she has assignments for sale. Let assume that Party B receives the info and he/or she make the counteroffer and put the price on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, let's say €40. Maybe they agree on €45.  As we see there is the great possibility to ease the situation of the debtor while allowing the parties to solve more delicate financing problems more flexible. The main idea here is that the debtor can always log on to the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and bid on the specific claim against which he is a debtor.

It is very easy to understand, every investor can buy stock and assume that what is happening behind the electronic market system, how the trade matching takes place and what are the consequences in the accounts when the deals are finally closed.

The Chinese law also recognizes the assignment of contractual rights and regards it as a change of parties to the contract. In essence, under Chinese law, assignment of contractual rights means that the parties to a duly formed contract may assign their contractual rights to a third person without changing the terms of the contract.22 Article 79 of the Chinese Contract Law provides that the obligee may assign all or part of its contractual rights to a third party. Chinese law allows the obligee to assign its contractual rights to a third party as long as the assignment does not violate law or social ethics. The underlying rationale is that the assignment of contracts may encourage transactions and promote the development of the market economy. However, in order to protect the public interest and maintain an orderly marketplace, as well as to balance the rights and interests of both parties, Chinese law also limits the scope of the assignment of contractual rights.23 According to Chinese law, there are three situations in which the contractual rights are not assignable: First, if the nature of the contractual rights makes them un-assignable, then the contractual rights may not be assigned to a third party.

Receivables market is mostly human trading. Electronic trading platforms for receivables, like stock exchanges, do not exist. There are some entrepreneurs and startups, the trading platforms are eBay-like online invoice trading and human-backed excel-based systems. There are no direct connections to investors. PlanetZiggurat goal is to bring assignments on Ecex.Exchange trading platform. We will fill the gap by creating a market environment, a system for an active trading platform of assignment agreements. This means changing for owners of a multitude of agreements and documents, such as claims, invoices and factoring agreements etc. The market system will be similar to the stock market – very transparent and fast and it will allow trading claims, invoices from the moment they are being issued until the payment date. Claims, invoices will be traded until the obligations are either met or erased due to bankruptcy or natural end of the issuer. The owner of the invoice or claim can delist his right any moment (and exercise his right to realize their own requirements). As all traders know, all markets function through leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. All traders want to be close to possibilities that allow them to make fast decisions and take actions directly, using market data and trading terminals. PlanetZiggurat will spread all relevant trading data to leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. We will make arrangements that will get the existing investor community connected to the new assignment market. Blockchain technology can be used to verify transactions using a third party. There are three tools planned: 1. The trading platform, exchange for claims, invoices and others subjects for assignments (all together assignments) 2. Exchange information flow through leading brokerage community. PlanetZiggurat will launch a trading platform to show and teach members and clients, https://ecex.exchange/  and https://planetziggurat.com/ 3. Blockchain, especially digital signature (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/)  PlanetZiggurat will start on the Estonian market due to the small size of the country as a test market and relatively high level of IT development in the country. This will allow to get a functional system up an running fast, have the system compatible with EU regulations and use a small market as a test site for further development in order to be able upscale in full range and functionality at bigger markets at the right time The stock exchange in Estonia is very small. There are 50 000 trades per year, the depository and market systems are designed for small volumes and are relatively cheap. PlanetZiggurat knows the involved persons and companies and is planning to build its systems with the same software and legal background. http://www.nasdaqbaltic.com/market/?lang=en PlanetZigurrat has an arrangement with an advisory company (http://bda.ee/en/) who will help to harmonize the system with legislation. This business plan, PlanetZiggurat OÜ Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform whitepaper, attempts to fill the gap described by European Commission Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union “DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY MARKETS FOR NON-PERFORMING LOANS AND DISTRESSED ASSETS AND PROTECTION OF SECURED CREDITORS FROM BORROWERS’ DEFAULT “ https://ico.ecex.exchange/",False

A business who provides supplies or services to a company or an individual and does not demand payment immediately is also considered a creditor, based on the fact that the client owes the business money for services already rendered. Creditors can be classified as either personal or real. People who loan money to friends or family are personal creditors. Real creditors such as banks or finance companies have legal contracts with the borrower, sometimes granting the lender the right to claim any of the debtor's real assets (e.g. real estate or cars) if he fails to pay back the loan. Simply, creditors make money by charging interest on the loans they offer their clients. For example, if a creditor lends a borrower $5,000 with a 5% interest rate, the lender makes money due to the interest on the loan. In turn, the creditor accepts a degree of risk that the borrower may not repay the loan. To mitigate risk, most creditors index their interest rates or fees to the borrower's creditworthiness and past credit history. Thus, being a responsible borrower could save you a substantial sum, particularly if you are taking out a large loan, like a mortgage. Interest rates for mortgages vary based on a myriad of factors, including the size of the down payment and the lender itself; however, one's creditworthiness has a primary impact one one's interest rate.  Assignment Long story short creditor is the owner of rights and these rights are on a form of written contract. This written contract is the object of the next contract – assignment.    Contract assignment. A contract assignment means that a party to the contract assigns the entire contract to another party. This means that the party gives the obligations and benefits of an existing contract to another party. This situation occurs when a party to a contract wants another party to completely step in and fulfill the contract. The ability to assign a contract to another party is a fairly common practice in contracts law. This type of assignment is common in a wide variety of different contract situations.  Assignment of Rights There is also a second type of assignment. Sometimes, an assignor will only make an assignment of rights. This means that the original party remains obligated to fulfill the contract, but another party receives the contractual benefits.  Assignor and Assignee An assignor can be an individual, a group, or a business. The assignor is the party that transfers its contractual rights to another party. In a contract assignment, this means that the party transfers both the contractual obligations and the contractual benefits. In an assignment of rights, this means that the party transfers just the benefit of the contract. The assignee is the party that receives the rights and obligations under the contract, but wasn't an original party to the contract. Usually, an assignee receives the contract rights and obligations directly from an original party to the contract.  Obligor and Obligee An obligor is a party that is obligated to do something under the terms of a contract. You will sometimes hear the term 'obligor' used to describe a 'borrower' or a 'debtor.' This is common because many contracts are debt contracts, but it's important to note that obligors can be required to do something other than repay debt. Obligors can be obligated to perform a particular task or even to refrain from a particular activity. Whenever we have an assignment and an obligor, we'll have an obligee.",False

We can only assume what indicators they taking account before they do their decisions and what are the main economic data that is relevant. But as an entrepreneur and investor ourselves, we have to do our jobs with the best knowledge about ecosystems and we have to give our best skills to achieve results.  Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform idea is raised from the deep knowledge about personal loan market and the use of assigning loans to other entity.  There is in the market startups who try to divide loans into peases and sell them as small investments on marketplaces. It is the solution but there is very little business for investors. Our solutions bring bid and ask possibilities and the familiar trading environment for all investors because it is hard to think that investor has never seen the stock market trader. And it is the first big benefit, the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform trading environment is familiar to investors.  Then, of course, the assignment. We published several articles about the cessio, assignment, assignor, assignee, debtor, transfer of right .. and so on.

Trade the claims. Create AA in EE, transfer these right from one user to another. Earn commission on that completed deal! The owners of the rights (claims, debts, ivoices etc) can be any bank or any private person. PZ will also use EE to trade tokens, cryptos and fiats (maybe divine too). How ever you turn the site is based on TRADING, not on WORKING. The trade can be very tedious work but we, the users online, we need a site where we can work and earn to pay our debts or buy them from debtors as AA. The twitter may be our main job as we have software already and 20 tweets and/or re-tweets per day could be accomplished in short time. On this activity a user could earn 40 ZIG (internally 40€, externally 0.0073 eth). That work could activate 1 DD from DAB of a user. DAB is a newest option online which requires the owners to recognize the user, not as consumer or customers, that he is a good person and that that goodness has the average value for of about 737373 dollars (mundane = divine). So, what is my aim! I want to implement divine money and employ users. PZ has only ZIG and 3 or 4 workers as the staff. The bounty portal could be expended to render services to all sites online, but main thing has to be that PZ pays clickers not that they depend on any outcome of their ICOs or so.

Also, some bounty workers have earned tokens that  they think they can sell for 100 but on exchanges they bid them 1. So, maybe 50 would be reasonable price to pay to token holder now!

For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for €100, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.  Let's take the step further. Assume that Party C put the obligation on the Party B to Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and he/she want this obligation sell and price is €50. He/She log in and put the asking price to €50 and sent the notification to other parties and the market that HE or she has assignments for sale.

If we promise to users and investors that we will go with 10 balances site (as my suggestion is, to be implemented) then we would start to buy sell all ZIG in span from 0.000737373 to 0.007373737. If the new expanded site picks up, well, we have to go to upper levels to close to 1 to 1 with ethereum.

We are going to mix existing ideas with existing ecosystems, even step into systems through existing channels and to bring certain possibilities to market attention. The regular item that everybody trades is a buy-sell agreement. It is very easy to understand, every investor can buy stock and assume that what is happening behind the electronic market system, how the trade matching takes place and what are the consequences in the accounts when the deals are finally closed. An ecosystem which is mostly the same as stock market and built only for claims, rights, and receivables, operates on the basis of assignment agreement, has a great opportunity to spread around the world and to gain customers everywhere.   How does the project create value to the ecosystem and differs from competing projects  Ziggurat Tokens represents a decentralized virtual currency represented in specialized Ethereum smart contracts following an ""ERC20"" standard. Ziggurat Tokens enable participants to interact with Ziggurat’s Ecex.Exchange marketplace services, as storage, content, and data are obtained with Ziggurat Tokens as partly a payment mechanism. First partnership access – Ziggurat Tokens ownership will give access to advanced platform’s features. Second, assignors and assignees on Ecex.Exchange trading platform rewarded with a Ziggurats bonus if they make a certain volume.

Receivables market is mostly human trading. Electronic trading platforms for receivables, like stock exchanges, do not exist. There are some entrepreneurs and startups, the trading platforms are eBay-like online invoice trading and human-backed excel-based systems. There are no direct connections to investors. PlanetZiggurat goal is to bring assignments on Ecex.Exchange trading platform. We will fill the gap by creating a market environment, a system for an active trading platform of assignment agreements. This means changing for owners of a multitude of agreements and documents, such as claims, invoices and factoring agreements etc. The market system will be similar to the stock market – very transparent and fast and it will allow trading claims, invoices from the moment they are being issued until the payment date. Claims, invoices will be traded until the obligations are either met or erased due to bankruptcy or natural end of the issuer. The owner of the invoice or claim can delist his right any moment (and exercise his right to realize their own requirements). As all traders know, all markets function through leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. All traders want to be close to possibilities that allow them to make fast decisions and take actions directly, using market data and trading terminals. PlanetZiggurat will spread all relevant trading data to leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. We will make arrangements that will get the existing investor community connected to the new assignment market. Blockchain technology can be used to verify transactions using a third party. There are three tools planned: 1. The trading platform, exchange for claims, invoices and others subjects for assignments (all together assignments) 2. Exchange information flow through leading brokerage community. PlanetZiggurat will launch a trading platform to show and teach members and clients, https://ecex.exchange/  and https://planetziggurat.com/ 3. Blockchain, especially digital signature (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/)  PlanetZiggurat will start on the Estonian market due to the small size of the country as a test market and relatively high level of IT development in the country. This will allow to get a functional system up an running fast, have the system compatible with EU regulations and use a small market as a test site for further development in order to be able upscale in full range and functionality at bigger markets at the right time The stock exchange in Estonia is very small. There are 50 000 trades per year, the depository and market systems are designed for small volumes and are relatively cheap. PlanetZiggurat knows the involved persons and companies and is planning to build its systems with the same software and legal background. http://www.nasdaqbaltic.com/market/?lang=en PlanetZigurrat has an arrangement with an advisory company (http://bda.ee/en/) who will help to harmonize the system with legislation.

For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for €100, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.  Let's take the step further. Assume that Party C put the obligation on the Party B to Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and he/she want this obligation sell and price is €50. He/She log in and put the asking price to €50 and sent the notification to other parties and the market that he or she has assignments for sale.

This means changing for owners of a multitude of agreements and documents, such as claims, invoices and factoring agreements etc. The market system will be similar to the stock market – very transparent and fast and it will allow trading claims, invoices from the moment they are being issued until the payment date. Claims, invoices will be traded until the obligations are either met or erased due to bankruptcy or natural end of the issuer. The owner of the invoice or claim can delist his right any moment (and exercise his right to realize their own requirements). As all traders know, all markets function through leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. All traders want to be close to possibilities that allow them to make fast decisions and take actions directly, using market data and trading terminals. PlanetZiggurat will spread all relevant trading data to leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. We will make arrangements that will get the existing investor community connected to the new assignment market. Blockchain technology can be used to verify transactions using a third party. There are three tools planned: 1. The trading platform, exchange for claims, invoices and others subjects for assignments (all together assignments) 2. Exchange information flow through leading brokerage community.

An assignment derived from Roman law cessio. Here is short overview, historical background   1.Roman Law  The Roman law provides an invaluable introduction to the understanding of legal concepts and a passport to the appreciation of Continental legal systems. Roman law is the product of the genius of good order and organized common sense of a remarkable ancient civilization, and it constitutes a legacy that has had a profound influence in subsequent ages.   2. Cessio   There are  two main institutes related to cessio:   - cessio bonorum: where a debtor had become insolvent owing to unforeseen circumstances, he could, under the formulary procedure, avoid the infamy attached to execution by petitioning a magistrate to allow him to make a voluntary cession of his property (cessio bonorum) to his creditors;  - cessio in iure: Litt. cession before a court. It was a ritual procedure (imitating the procedure of the legis actio sacramento in rem) already known by the time of the Twelve Tables that was used to create, transfer or extinguish certain rights (specifically the so-called “Quiritary rights”). It partly fell into disuse in classical Roman law.  Cessio bonorum, (Latin: “a cession of goods”), a voluntary surrender of goods by a debtor to his creditors. It did not amount to a discharge of the debt unless the property ceded was sufficient for the purpose, but it secured the debtor from personal arrest. The creditors sold the goods, applying the proceeds to their claims. Although property that the debtor might acquire later could be claimed by the creditors, he could not be deprived of the bare necessities. The main features of cessio bonorum were adopted into the French and other legal systems. In England it survives in the internal regulations of certain commercial bodies, such as stock exchanges. Cessio bonorum ,was a procedure introduced by Augustus reign (Republic) , whereby a judgement debtor voluntarily surrendered his property to the creditors. The property was sold off, but the debtor would not be subjected to legal disgrace or to the possible imprisonment by the creditors. Surrender was not available as of the right: it applied only there the preator was satisfied that the debtor had genuine assets and that the bankruptcy was the result of misfortune.  In jure cessio was a conveyance in the form of a lawsuit. The transferee claimed before the magistrate that the thing was his, and the transferor, who was the defendant, admitted the claim. The magistrate then adjudged the thing to the transferee. (The sham-lawsuit theory, however, is not acceptable to all modern scholars, principally because the judgment of ownership was valid against any possible private claimant, not merely against the defendant, as in a true lawsuit.)   Cessio had some similarities to mancipatio. It was a highly formal and cumbersome conveyance, originating before the Twelve Tables and fading in importance long before Justinian. Our knowledge of cessio is derived mainly from Gaius, who tells us(Inst.Gai.2.24) that cessio was performed before a magistrate, such as the preator(or governor) with the transferor and transferee present, together with the property to be transferred (or a symbolic sod of earth in the case of land). The transferee grasped the property and uttered the same set words as in mancipatio. The preator asked the transferor thether he claimed the thing. Assuming that the latter stayed silent, or made no claim, he was taken as having ceded his rights, whereupon the preator awarded the property to the transferee.""

A Trading Platform can also introduce divestitures of the claim into the debtor, which means that the debtor can place the sales claims against her/him.This option turns the whole loan-giving logic around.In real life, this means that borrowers place their divestitures of claims against her/himself on the Trading Platform and wait for lender offers. They can put the price that they hope and the lenders have to fight to get the deal. Visual picture is like the stock market, but the instruments are different.

Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, NPSs, banks.  Currently, world markets for distressed debt tend to be characterized by comparatively small trade volumes, a limited number of active investors and large bid-ask spreads. This might reflect various factors, such as significant differences in the required rates of return for banks and investors and in loan recovery expectations, and how servicing costs are taken into account. Ecex.Exchange understand how this market currently functions and gather information how could assist its further development. In particular, it is of interest to ascertain if there are specific the gap to fill that constrain the assignment of loans.(Ecex.Exchange expertise) The lack of independent servicing capacity in some markets may hinder the development of liquid secondary markets for loans and especially distressed debt. That kind of independent services Ecex.Exchange exactly propose. Furthermore, when banks and credit companies assign defaulted loans, third-party servicers as Ecex.Exchange  represents an alternative to manage those loans on behalf of investors, which usually do not have appropriate capacity to service NPLs.   2. Assignment of loans  Banks may assign performing or non-performing loans to outside investors in order to manage the composition of their balance sheet, their risks and to allow a potential business model re-orientation. Loan contracts can, in principle, be assigned from the originating creditor to a third-party investor under private law regimes. This is most often done via an assignment agreement with the new creditor, which takes over the original creditor's rights and obligations. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is meant exactly for that kind of business.Banks will introduce NPLs on our platform and potential assignees will obtain the rights trough assignment agreement. Sales can contribute to strengthening banks’ balance sheets and their profitability in the medium to long-term, as the transferring bank would not incur the additional administrative expenses and potential additional losses related to the future management of the loans. In addition, removing NPLs from a bank's balance sheet reduces the uncertainty around the bank's asset quality and loan valuations, as uncertainty on possible future losses associated with the NPL portfolio disappears. In the short term, however, the assignment of NPLs might in some cases stress the bank's capital position and raise concerns regarding the viability of the bank. In some cases, assignee of NPL contracts, including non-banks, may be more effective in recovering value, in particular through the potential use of better management and servicing. Especially some smaller banks may lack the required in-house capacities and internal processes to manage large portfolios of non-performing loans. Moreover, banks and non-bank investors may face a different set of incentives and constraints when managing loans. Banks may be more reluctant to restructure loans to avoid moral hazard and so-called strategic defaults of existing borrowers. Today an important aspect of the functioning of secondary markets for NPLs are the large bid-ask spreads. Ecex.Exchange will reduce spreads and it decreases uncertainties about future cash flows, information asymmetries between assignors and assignees and also first-mover disadvantages/ coordination challenges. Together, these factors may significantly constrain the price discovery process. Potential assignees tend not to have access to reliable, granular, readily available standardized information on asset quality and loan tapes in banks. As a consequence, potential assignees may in some cases offer a price that does not reflect the value of portfolios for sale, thus hindering potential transactions.However, Ecex.Exchange provides stock market like price possibilities and assignors and assignees will present they best prices and wills and it is nature of the business that at some point prices are suitable for both parties.     3.Ziggurat Tokens  Ziggurat tokens shall provide for the user, today's case the banks, opportunities to sell and buy assignments (NPLs) for certain prices. There is the example: All service fees are for Ziggurat Token holders payable with Ziggurat Tokens. Let assume that assignment cost is 20 EUR. Ziggurat Tokens holder will pay 20 Ziggurats. Let assume that guest service fee is 50 EUR.Ziggurat Tokens holder will pay 50 Ziggurats. For paying for Exec.Exchange Trading Platform services Ziggurat Tokens can be used on exchange rate 1 ZIG  = 1 USD (this rate only Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform if paying for services.). We project our assignments amount several million, in the end, third year. It gives great opportunity trade tokens in free marketplaces or uses them on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform.The Ziggurat Tokens will be an integral part of the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform as a means to support and pay for the services on the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform.",False

By an assignment, an obligee (one who has the right to receive a contract benefit) transfers a right to receive a contract benefit owed by the obligor (the one who has a duty to perform) to a third person (assignee); the obligee then becomes an assignor (one who makes an assignment).  The Restatement (Second) of Contracts defines an assignment of a right as “a manifestation of the assignor’s intention to transfer it by virtue of which the assignor’s right to performance by the obligor is extinguished in whole or in part and the assignee acquires the right to such performance.”Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 317(1). The one who makes the assignment is both an obligee and a transferor. The assignee acquires the right to receive the contractual obligations of the promisor, who is referred to as the obligor (see Figure 10.1 ""Assignment of Rights""). The assignor may assign any right unless (1) doing so would materially change the obligation of the obligor, materially burden him, increase his risk, or otherwise diminish the value to him of the original contract; (2) statute or public policy forbids the assignment; or (3) the contract itself precludes assignment. The common law of contracts and Articles 2 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) govern assignments. Assignments are an important part of business financing, such as factoring. A factor is one who purchases the right to receive income from another.  Figure 10.1 Assignment of Rights     Method of Assignment Manifesting Assent To effect an assignment, the assignor must make known his intention to transfer the rights to the third person. The assignor’s intention must be that the assignment is effective without need of any further action or any further manifestation of intention to make the assignment. In other words, the assignor must intend and understand himself to be making the assignment then and there; he is not promising to make the assignment sometime in the future.  Under the UCC, any assignments of rights in excess of $5,000 must be in writing, but otherwise, assignments can be oral and consideration is not required: the assignor could assign the right to the assignee for nothing (not likely in commercial transactions, of course). Mrs. Franklin has the right to receive $750 a month from the sale of a house she formerly owned; she assigns the right to receive the money to her son Jason, as a gift. The assignment is good, though such a gratuitous assignment is usually revocable, which is not the case where consideration has been paid for an assignment.  Acceptance and Revocation For the assignment to become effective, the assignee must manifest his acceptance under most circumstances. This is done automatically when, as is usually the case, the assignee has given consideration for the assignment (i.e., there is a contract between the assignor and the assignee in which the assignment is the assignor’s consideration), and then the assignment is not revocable without the assignee’s consent. Problems of acceptance normally arise only when the assignor intends the assignment as a gift. Then, for the assignment to be irrevocable, either the assignee must manifest his acceptance or the assignor must notify the assignee in writing of the assignment.  Notice Notice to the obligor is not required, but an obligor who renders performance to the assignor without notice of the assignment (that performance of the contract is to be rendered now to the assignee) is discharged. Obviously, the assignor cannot then keep the consideration he has received; he owes it to the assignee. But if notice is given to the obligor and she performs to the assignor anyway, the assignee can recover from either the obligor or the assignee, so the obligor could have to perform twice, as in Exercise 2 at the chapter’s end, Aldana v. Colonial Palms Plaza. Of course, an obligor who receives notice of the assignment from the assignee will want to be sure the assignment has really occurred. After all, anybody could waltz up to the obligor and say, “I’m the assignee of your contract with the bank. From now on, pay me the $500 a month, not the bank.” The obligor is entitled to verification of the assignment.  Effect of Assignment General Rule An assignment of rights effectively makes the assignee stand in the shoes of the assignor. He gains all the rights against the obligor that the assignor had, but no more. An obligor who could avoid the assignor’s attempt to enforce the rights could avoid a similar attempt by the assignee. Likewise, under UCC Section 9-318(1), the assignee of an account is subject to all terms of the contract between the debtor and the creditor-assignor. Suppose Dealer sells a car to Buyer on a contract where Buyer is to pay $300 per month and the car is warranted for 50,000 miles. If the car goes on the fritz before then and Dealer won’t fix it, Buyer could fix it for, say, $250 and deduct that $250 from the amount owed Dealer on the next installment (called a setoff). Now, if Dealer assigns the contract to Assignee, Assignee stands in Dealer’s shoes, and Buyer could likewise deduct the $250 from payment to Assignee.  Exceptions The “shoe rule” does not apply to two types of assignments. First, it is inapplicable to the sale of a negotiable instrument to a holder in due course (covered in detail Chapter 17 ""Negotiation of Commercial Paper""). Second, the rule may be waived: under the UCC and at common law, the obligor may agree in the original contract not to raise defenses against the assignee that could have been raised against the assignor.Uniform Commercial Code, Section 9-206. While a waiver of defenses makes the assignment more marketable from the assignee’s point of view, it is a situation fraught with peril to an obligor, who may sign a contract without understanding the full import of the waiver. Under the waiver rule, for example, a farmer who buys a tractor on credit and discovers later that it does not work would still be required to pay a credit company that purchased the contract; his defense that the merchandise was shoddy would be unavailing (he would, as used to be said, be “having to pay on a dead horse”).  For that reason, there are various rules that limit both the holder in due course and the waiver rule. Certain defenses, the so-called real defenses (infancy, duress, and fraud in the execution, among others), may always be asserted. Also, the waiver clause in the contract must have been presented in good faith, and if the assignee has actual notice of a defense that the buyer or lessee could raise, then the waiver is ineffective. Moreover, in consumer transactions, the UCC’s rule is subject to state laws that protect consumers (people buying things used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes), and many states, by statute or court decision, have made waivers of defenses ineffective in such consumer transactions. Federal Trade Commission regulations also affect the ability of many sellers to pass on rights to assignees free of defenses that buyers could raise against them. Because of these various limitations on the holder in due course and on waivers, the “shoe rule” will not govern in consumer transactions and, if there are real defenses or the assignee does not act in good faith, in business transactions as well.  When Assignments Are Not Allowed The general rule—as previously noted—is that most contract rights are assignable. But there are exceptions. Five of them are noted here.  Material Change in Duties of the Obligor When an assignment has the effect of materially changing the duties that the obligor must perform, it is ineffective. Changing the party to whom the obligor must make a payment is not a material change of duty that will defeat an assignment, since that, of course, is the purpose behind most assignments. Nor will a minor change in the duties the obligor must perform defeat the assignment.  Several residents in the town of Centerville sign up on an annual basis with the Centerville Times to receive their morning paper. A customer who is moving out of town may assign his right to receive the paper to someone else within the delivery route. As long as the assignee pays for the paper, the assignment is effective; the only relationship the obligor has to the assignee is a routine delivery in exchange for payment. Obligors can consent in the original contract, however, to a subsequent assignment of duties. Here is a clause from the World Team Tennis League contract: “It is mutually agreed that the Club shall have the right to sell, assign, trade and transfer this contract to another Club in the League, and the Player agrees to accept and be bound by such sale, exchange, assignment or transfer and to faithfully perform and carry out his or her obligations under this contract as if it had been entered into by the Player and such other Club.” Consent is not necessary when the contract does not involve a personal relationship.  Assignment of Personal Rights When it matters to the obligor who receives the benefit of his duty to perform under the contract, then the receipt of the benefit is a personal right that cannot be assigned. For example, a student seeking to earn pocket money during the school year signs up to do research work for a professor she admires and with whom she is friendly. The professor assigns the contract to one of his colleagues with whom the student does not get along. The assignment is ineffective because it matters to the student (the obligor) who the person of the assignee is. An insurance company provides auto insurance covering Mohammed Kareem, a sixty-five-year-old man who drives very carefully. Kareem cannot assign the contract to his seventeen-year-old grandson because it matters to the insurance company who the person of its insured is. Tenants usually cannot assign (sublet) their tenancies without the landlord’s permission because it matters to the landlord who the person of their tenant is. Section 10.4.1 ""Nonassignable Rights"", Nassau Hotel Co. v. Barnett & Barse Corp., is an example of the nonassignability of a personal right.  Assignment Forbidden by Statute or Public Policy Various federal and state laws prohibit or regulate some contract assignment. The assignment of future wages is regulated by state and federal law to protect people from improvidently denying themselves future income because of immediate present financial difficulties. And even in the absence of statute, public policy might prohibit some assignments.  Contracts That Prohibit Assignment Assignability of contract rights is useful, and prohibitions against it are not generally favored. Many contracts contain general language that prohibits assignment of rights or of “the contract.” Both the Restatement and UCC Section 2-210(3) declare that in the absence of any contrary circumstances, a provision in the agreement that prohibits assigning “the contract” bars “only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor’s performance.”Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 322. In other words, unless the contract specifically prohibits assignment of any of its terms, a party is free to assign anything except his or her own duties.  Even if a contractual provision explicitly prohibits it, a right to damages for breach of the whole contract is assignable under UCC Section 2-210(2) in contracts for goods. Likewise, UCC Section 9-318(4) invalidates any contract provision that prohibits assigning sums already due or to become due. Indeed, in some states, at common law, a clause specifically prohibiting assignment will fail. For example, the buyer and the seller agree to the sale of land and to a provision barring assignment of the rights under the contract. The buyer pays the full price, but the seller refuses to convey. The buyer then assigns to her friend the right to obtain title to the land from the seller. The latter’s objection that the contract precludes such an assignment will fall on deaf ears in some states; the assignment is effective, and the friend may sue for the title.  Future Contracts The law distinguishes between assigning future rights under an existing contract and assigning rights that will arise from a future contract. Rights contingent on a future event can be assigned in exactly the same manner as existing rights, as long as the contingent rights are already incorporated in a contract. Ben has a long-standing deal with his neighbor, Mrs. Robinson, to keep the latter’s walk clear of snow at twenty dollars a snowfall. Ben is saving his money for a new printer, but when he is eighty dollars shy of the purchase price, he becomes impatient and cajoles a friend into loaning him the balance. In return, Ben assigns his friend the earnings from the next four snowfalls. The assignment is effective. However, a right that will arise from a future contract cannot be the subject of a present assignment.  Partial Assignments An assignor may assign part of a contractual right, but only if the obligor can perform that part of his contractual obligation separately from the remainder of his obligation. Assignment of part of a payment due is always enforceable. However, if the obligor objects, neither the assignor nor the assignee may sue him unless both are party to the suit. Mrs. Robinson owes Ben one hundred dollars. Ben assigns fifty dollars of that sum to his friend. Mrs. Robinson is perplexed by this assignment and refuses to pay until the situation is explained to her satisfaction. The friend brings suit against Mrs. Robinson. The court cannot hear the case unless Ben is also a party to the suit. This ensures all parties to the dispute are present at once and avoids multiple lawsuits.  Successive Assignments It may happen that an assignor assigns the same interest twice (see Figure 10.2 ""Successive Assignments""). With certain exceptions, the first assignee takes precedence over any subsequent assignee. One obvious exception is when the first assignment is ineffective or revocable. A subsequent assignment has the effect of revoking a prior assignment that is ineffective or revocable. Another exception: if in good faith the subsequent assignee gives consideration for the assignment and has no knowledge of the prior assignment, he takes precedence whenever he obtains payment from, performance from, or a judgment against the obligor, or whenever he receives some tangible evidence from the assignor that the right has been assigned (e.g., a bank deposit book or an insurance policy).  Some states follow the different English rule: the first assignee to give notice to the obligor has priority, regardless of the order in which the assignments were made. Furthermore, if the assignment falls within the filing requirements of UCC Article 9 (see Chapter 21 ""Secured Transactions and Suretyship""), the first assignee to file will prevail.  Figure 10.2 Successive Assignments    Assignor’s Warranties An assignor has legal responsibilities in making assignments. He cannot blithely assign the same interests pell-mell and escape liability. Unless the contract explicitly states to the contrary, a person who assigns a right for value makes certain assignor’s warranties to the assignee: that he will not upset the assignment, that he has the right to make it, and that there are no defenses that will defeat it. However, the assignor does not guarantee payment; assignment does not by itself amount to a warranty that the obligor is solvent or will perform as agreed in the original contract. Mrs. Robinson owes Ben fifty dollars. Ben assigns this sum to his friend. Before the friend collects, Ben releases Mrs. Robinson from her obligation. The friend may sue Ben for the fifty dollars. Or again, if Ben represents to his friend that Mrs. Robinson owes him (Ben) fifty dollars and assigns his friend that amount, but in fact Mrs. Robinson does not owe Ben that much, then Ben has breached his assignor’s warranty. The assignor’s warranties may be express or implied.",False

A business who provides supplies or services to a company or an individual and does not demand payment immediately is also considered a creditor, based on the fact that the client owes the business money for services already rendered. Creditors can be classified as either personal or real. People who loan money to friends or family are personal creditors. Real creditors such as banks or finance companies have legal contracts with the borrower, sometimes granting the lender the right to claim any of the debtor's real assets (e.g. real estate or cars) if he fails to pay back the loan. Simply, creditors make money by charging interest on the loans they offer their clients. For example, if a creditor lends a borrower $5,000 with a 5% interest rate, the lender makes money due to the interest on the loan. In turn, the creditor accepts a degree of risk that the borrower may not repay the loan. To mitigate risk, most creditors index their interest rates or fees to the borrower's creditworthiness and past credit history. Thus, being a responsible borrower could save you a substantial sum, particularly if you are taking out a large loan, like a mortgage. Interest rates for mortgages vary based on a myriad of factors, including the size of the down payment and the lender itself; however, one's creditworthiness has a primary impact one one's interest rate.  Assignment Long story short creditor is the owner of rights and these rights are on a form of written contract. This written contract is the object of the next contract – assignment.     Contract assignment. A contract assignment means that a party to the contract assigns the entire contract to another party. This means that the party gives the obligations and benefits of an existing contract to another party. This situation occurs when a party to a contract wants another party to completely step in and fulfill the contract. The ability to assign a contract to another party is a fairly common practice in contracts law. This type of assignment is common in a wide variety of different contract situations.  Assignment of Rights There is also a second type of assignment. Sometimes, an assignor will only make an assignment of rights. This means that the original party remains obligated to fulfill the contract, but another party receives the contractual benefits.  Assignor and Assignee An assignor can be an individual, a group, or a business. The assignor is the party that transfers its contractual rights to another party. In a contract assignment, this means that the party transfers both the contractual obligations and the contractual benefits. In an assignment of rights, this means that the party transfers just the benefit of the contract. The assignee is the party that receives the rights and obligations under the contract, but wasn't an original party to the contract. Usually, an assignee receives the contract rights and obligations directly from an original party to the contract.  Obligor and Obligee An obligor is a party that is obligated to do something under the terms of a contract. You will sometimes hear the term 'obligor' used to describe a 'borrower' or a 'debtor.' This is common because many contracts are debt contracts, but it's important to note that obligors can be required to do something other than repay debt.

We can only assume what indicators they taking account before they do their decisions and what are the main economic data that is relevant. But as an entrepreneur and investor ourselves, we have to do our jobs with the best knowledge about ecosystems and we have to give our best skills to achieve results.  Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform idea is raised from the deep knowledge about personal loan market and the use of assigning loans to other entity.  There is in the market startups who try to divide loans into peases and sell them as small investments on marketplaces. It is the solution but there is very little business for investors. Our solutions bring bid and ask possibilities and the familiar trading environment for all investors because it is hard to think that investor has never seen the stock market trader. And it is the first big benefit, the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform trading environment is familiar to investors.  Then, of course, the assignment. We published several articles about the cessio, assignment, assignor, assignee, debtor, transfer of right .. and so on. Our goal is to explain to future Ziggurat token buyers what our Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is all about. Ecex.Exchange is, in short, the transfer of rights from one owner to another and the transfer of this transaction to independent economic agents.Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform earns a commission on transactions.

For many companies, utility appears to be an afterthought, but for a token to be successfully adopted into the community, it is the most critical component. With the amount of tokens on the market today, and new ones being launched every day, it’s clear there is a bubble, though the size of it might be debatable.” https://www.coindesk.com/defining-word-tokens-2018/  Shawn Wilkinson from Coindesk argued 3 ways companies have to create they utility Tokens and we tried to connect dots  and show that our Ziggurat Token is 100% utility Tokens.  The first argument is about purchasing services. PlanetZiggurat issued tokens mainly for two reasons. First is about collecting financing for future development and second is to find useful way connect service buyers to our Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform. „Purchasing services with tokens accelerates the time it takes for a transaction to settle, it makes purchasing services easier and adds an element of privacy as well. In the beginning, when the company is scaling and spending more money than they are making, the volume of tokens exchanged for the purchase of services will be minimal, but as the company’s revenues grow, so will the token transfer rate. You don’t need to require tokens to purchase services, but providing the option (and possibly providing a discount for doing so) can go a long way in driving the use of your token.”  The second argument is about the create a self-sustainable ecosystem. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is developed exactly for solutions like using utility Tokens. Trading Platform is using ethereum smart contract solutions, allowed client make transactions with different money and coin solutions ethereum, bitcoin and free market Tokens included. We will create a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, facilitating transactions utilizing Ziggurat token and we create a self-sustaining ecosystem that is based on transacting our Ziggurat token.  The third argument is about automated smart contract payments. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform will definitely use smart contract but our first option is to use them to approve contracts. There will be several NDA agreements what have to be approved besides the main assignment agreement contract and ethereum smart contract solution giving us that possibility. We do not rule out automated smart contract payments entirely, but our business model fundamental agreement take place between our client and we have only advisable and deliberative role. Automated payments capabilities can be used on our Trading Platform regarding trading service fees and on same side-products as phone payments or wallet services.   The conclusion is that Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform Ziggurat Tokens fit well into the definition of the utility token.",False

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND CESSIO (assignment)  1.1.Roman Law  The Roman law provides an invaluable introduction to the understanding of legal concepts and a passport to the appreciation of Continental legal systems. Roman law is the product of the genius of good order and organized common sense of a remarkable ancient civilization, and it constitutes a legacy that has had a profound influence in subsequent ages.   1.2. Cessio   There are  two main institutes related to cessio:  - cessio bonorum: where a debtor had become insolvent owing to unforeseen circumstances, he could, under the formulary procedure, avoid the infamy attached to execution by petitioning a magistrate to allow him to make a voluntary cession of his property (cessio bonorum) to his creditors;  - cessio in iure: Litt. cession before a court. It was a ritual procedure (imitating the procedure of the legis actio sacramento in rem) already known by the time of the Twelve Tables that was used to create, transfer or extinguish certain rights (specifically the so-called “Quiritary rights”). It partly fell into disuse in classical Roman law.1.  Cessio bonorum, (Latin: “a cession of goods”), a voluntary surrender of goods by a debtor to his creditors. It did not amount to a discharge of the debt unless the property ceded was sufficient for the purpose, but it secured the debtor from personal arrest. The creditors sold the goods, applying the proceeds to their claims. Although property that the debtor might acquire later could be claimed by the creditors, he could not be deprived of the bare necessities. The main features of cessio bonorum were adopted into the French and other legal systems. In England it survives in the internal regulations of certain commercial bodies, such as stock exchanges. Cessio bonorum ,was a procedure introduced by Augustus reign (Republic) , whereby a judgement debtor voluntarily surrendered his property to the creditors. The property was sold off, but the debtor would not be subjected to legal disgrace or to the possible imprisonment by the creditors. Surrender was not available as of the right: it applied only there the preator was satisfied that the debtor had genuine assets and that the bankruptcy was the result of misfortune.  In jure cessio was a conveyance in the form of a lawsuit. The transferee claimed before the magistrate that the thing was his, and the transferor, who was the defendant, admitted the claim. The magistrate then adjudged the thing to the transferee. (The sham-lawsuit theory, however, is not acceptable to all modern scholars, principally because the judgment of ownership was valid against any possible private claimant, not merely against the defendant, as in a true lawsuit.) 2 Cessio had some similarities to mancipatio. It was a highly formal and cumbersome conveyance, originating before the Twelve Tables and fading in importance long before Justinian. Our knowledge of cessio is derived mainly from Gaius, who tells us(Inst.Gai.2.24) that cessio was performed before a magistrate, such as the preator(or governor) with the transferor and transferee present, together with the property to be transferred (or a symbolic sod of earth in the case of land). The transferee grasped the property and uttered the same set words as in mancipatio. The preator asked the transferor thether he claimed the thing. Assuming that the latter stayed silent, or made no claim, he was taken as having ceded his rights, whereupon the preator awarded the property to the transferee.3",False

ASSIGNMENT  An assignment (Latin cessio) is a term used with similar meanings in the law of contracts and in the law of real estate. In both instances, it encompasses the transfer of rights held by one party—the assignor—to another party—the assignee. It can also be a transfer of a benefit, including an equitable interest, according to established rules (at common law or in equity).The rights may be vested or contingent. The details of the assignment determine some additional rights and liabilities (or duties). Typically a third-party is involved in a contract with the assignor, and the contract is in effect transferred to the assignee. For example, a borrower borrows money from a local bank. The local bank receives a mortgage note and can thereafter transfer that note to a financial institution in exchange for a lump-sum of cash, thereby assigning the right to receive payment from the borrower to another entity. Mortgages and lending contracts are relatively amenable to assignment since the lender's duties are relatively limited; other contracts which involve personal duties such as legal counsel may not be assignable. The related concept of novation is not  an assignment; rather than assigning only the rights to another party, novation involves the replacement of the original party with a new party or the replacement of the original contract with a new contract. Since novation creates a new contract, it requires the consent of all parties whereas assignment does not require the consent of the nonassigning party, although in the case of assignment the consent of the nonassigning party may be required through a contractual provision      2.1. Procedure  The assignment does not necessarily have to be in writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish privity (in other words, contractual relationship, including the right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party obligor and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.       2.1.1.   Liabilities and duties  Unless the contractual agreement states otherwise, the assignee typically does not receive greater rights than the assignor, and the assignor may remain liable to the original counterparty for the performance of the contract. The assignor often delegates duties in addition to rights to the assignee, but the assignor may remain ultimately responsible.     2.1.2.  Assignment of contract rights  Assignment of rights under a contract is the complete transfer of the rights to receive the benefits accruing to one of the parties to that contract. For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for $10, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.1",False

Receivables market is mostly human trading. Electronic trading platforms for receivables, like stock exchanges, do not exist. There are some entrepreneurs and startups, the trading platforms are eBay-like online invoice trading and human-backed excel-based systems. There are no direct connections to investors. PlanetZiggurat goal is to bring assignments on Ecex.Exchange trading platform. We will fill the gap by creating a market environment, system for active trading platform of assignment agreements. This means changing of owners of a multitude of agreements and documents, such as claims, invoices and factoring agreements etc. The market system will be similar to the stock market – very transparent and fast and it will allow trading claims, invoices from the moment they are being issued until the payment date. Claims, invoices will be traded until the obligations are either met or erased due to bankruptcy or natural end of the issuer. The owner of the invoice or claim can delist his right any moment (and exercise his right to realize their own requirements). As all traders know, all markets function through leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. All traders want to be close to possibilities that allow them to make fast decisions and make actions directly, using market data and trading terminals. PlanetZiggurat will spread all relevant trading data to leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. We will make arrangements that will get the existing investor community connected to the new assignment market. Blockchain technology can be used to verify transactions using a third party. There are three tools planned: 1. The trading platform, exchange for claims, invoices and others subjects for assignments (all together assignments) 2. Exchange information flow through leading brokerage community. PlanetZiggurat will launch a trading platform to show and teach members and clients, https://ecex.exchange/  and https://planetziggurat.com/ 3. Blockchain, especially digital signature (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/)  PlanetZiggurat will start on the Estonian market due to the small size of the country as a test market and relatively high level of IT development in the country. This will allow to get a functional system up an running fast, have the system compatible with EU regulations and use a small market as a test site for further development in order to be able upscale in full range and functionality at bigger markets at the right time The stock exchange in Estonia is very small. There are 50 000 trades per year, the depository and market systems are designed for small volumes and are relatively cheap. PlanetZiggurat knows the involved persons and companies and is planning to build its systems with the same software and legal background. Nasdaq Baltic PlanetZigurrat  has an arrangement with an advisory company BDA Consulting who will help to harmonize the system with legislation.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND  1.1.Roman Law  The Roman law provides an invaluable introduction to the understanding of legal concepts and a passport to the appreciation of Continental legal systems. Roman law is the product of the genius of good order and organized common sense of a remarkable ancient civilization, and it constitutes a legacy that has had a profound influence in subsequent ages.   1.2. Cessio   There are  two main institutes related to cessio:  - cessio bonorum: where a debtor had become insolvent owing to unforeseen circumstances, he could, under the formulary procedure, avoid the infamy attached to execution by petitioning a magistrate to allow him to make a voluntary cession of his property (cessio bonorum) to his creditors;  - cessio in iure: Litt. cession before a court. It was a ritual procedure (imitating the procedure of the legis actio sacramento in rem) already known by the time of the Twelve Tables that was used to create, transfer or extinguish certain rights (specifically the so-called “Quiritary rights”). It partly fell into disuse in classical Roman law.1.  Cessio bonorum, (Latin: “a cession of goods”), a voluntary surrender of goods by a debtor to his creditors. It did not amount to a discharge of the debt unless the property ceded was sufficient for the purpose, but it secured the debtor from personal arrest. The creditors sold the goods, applying the proceeds to their claims. Although property that the debtor might acquire later could be claimed by the creditors, he could not be deprived of the bare necessities. The main features of cessio bonorum were adopted into the French and other legal systems. In England it survives in the internal regulations of certain commercial bodies, such as stock exchanges. Cessio bonorum ,was a procedure introduced by Augustus reign (Republic) , whereby a judgment debtor voluntarily surrendered his property to the creditors. The property was sold off, but the debtor would not be subjected to legal disgrace or to the possible imprisonment by the creditors. Surrender was not available as of the right: it applied only there the preator was satisfied that the debtor had genuine assets and that the bankruptcy was the result of misfortune.  In jure cessio was a conveyance in the form of a lawsuit. The transferee claimed before the magistrate that the thing was his, and the transferor, who was the defendant, admitted the claim. The magistrate then adjudged the thing to the transferee. (The sham-lawsuit theory, however, is not acceptable to all modern scholars, principally because the judgment of ownership was valid against any possible private claimant, not merely against the defendant, as in a true lawsuit.) 2 Cessio had some similarities to mancipatio. It was a highly formal and cumbersome conveyance, originating before the Twelve Tables and fading in importance long before Justinian. Our knowledge of cessio is derived mainly from Gaius, who tells us(Inst.Gai.2.24) that cessio was performed before a magistrate, such as the preator(or governor) with the transferor and transferee present, together with the property to be transferred (or a symbolic sod of earth in the case of land). The transferee grasped the property and uttered the same set words as in mancipatio. The preator asked the transferor thether he claimed the thing. Assuming that the latter stayed silent, or made no claim, he was taken as having ceded his rights, whereupon the preator awarded the property to the transferee.",False

ASSIGNMENT  An assignment (Latin cessio) is a term used with similar meanings in the law of contracts and in the law of real estate. In both instances, it encompasses the transfer of rights held by one party—the assignor—to another party—the assignee. It can also be a transfer of a benefit, including an equitable interest, according to established rules (at common law or in equity).The rights may be vested or contingent. The details of the assignment determine some additional rights and liabilities (or duties). Typically a third-party is involved in a contract with the assignor, and the contract is in effect transferred to the assignee. For example, a borrower borrows money from a local bank. The local bank receives a mortgage note and can thereafter transfer that note to a financial institution in exchange for a lump-sum of cash, thereby assigning the right to receive payment from the borrower to another entity. Mortgages and lending contracts are relatively amenable to assignment since the lender's duties are relatively limited; other contracts which involve personal duties such as legal counsel may not be assignable. The related concept of novation is not  an assignment; rather than assigning only the rights to another party, novation involves the replacement of the original party with a new party or the replacement of the original contract with a new contract. Since novation creates a new contract, it requires the consent of all parties whereas assignment does not require the consent of the nonassigning party, although in the case of assignment the consent of the nonassigning party may be required through a contractual provision      2.1. Procedure  The assignment does not necessarily have to be in writing; however, the assignment agreement must show an intent to transfer rights. The effect of a valid assignment is to extinguish privity (in other words, contractual relationship, including the right to sue) between the assignor and the third-party obligor and create privity between the obligor and the assignee.       2.1.1.   Liabilities and duties  Unless the contractual agreement states otherwise, the assignee typically does not receive greater rights than the assignor, and the assignor may remain liable to the original counterparty for the performance of the contract. The assignor often delegates duties in addition to rights to the assignee, but the assignor may remain ultimately responsible.     2.1.2.  Assignment of contract rights  Assignment of rights under a contract is the complete transfer of the rights to receive the benefits accruing to one of the parties to that contract. For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for $10, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.1",False

One of the most interesting in the ICO world is the question how we can use tokens and what benefits and profits we will get. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform will introduce in series articles how and then Ziggurat tokens holders can use and how our Trading Platform will work. Our Trading Platform ecosystems allow use tokens in every deal if parties agreed to use tokens in the mutual settlement. And there is the question not only Ziggurat tokens but every token, coins or another instrument that represent the value that parties suit and agreed. On Trading Platform, of course, all fees can pay with Ziggurat tokens and we prefer that deals are performed in Ziggurat token as well. The world is the big place and all possible assignments including claims, factoring agreements, receivables, bills, loan agreements and other digital assets are issued in different currencies and it is essential that our Trading Platform allows all these transactions made by our users.

Introducing debtors possibility to sell claim against her/himself.  The essence of Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is the negotiation of the divestiture agreements, which means that the assignor enters our Trading Platform in his assignment. Assignor is the role meant that this role can be filled in every person and the even debtor can introduce her/his dept. A Trading Platform can also introduce divestitures of the claim into the debtor, which means that the debtor can place the sales claims against her/him.This option turns the whole loan-giving logic around.In real life, this means that borrowers place their divestitures of claims against her/himself on the Trading Platform and wait for lender offers. They can put the price that they hope and the lenders have to fight to get the deal. Visual picture is like the stock market, but the instruments are different. And bid/ask are filled in that case ask side from debtor and bid side from the lender.

We are going to mix existing ideas with existing ecosystems, even step into systems through existing channels and to bring certain possibilities to market attention. The regular item that everybody trades is a buy-sell agreement. It is very easy to understand, every investor can buy stock and assume that what is happening behind the electronic market system, how the trade matching takes place and what are the consequences in the accounts when the deals are finally closed. An ecosystem which is mostly the same as stock market and built only for claims, rights, and receivables, operates on the basis of assignment agreement, has a great opportunity to spread around the world and to gain customers everywhere.   How does the project create value to the ecosystem and differs from competing projects  Ziggurat Tokens represents a decentralized virtual currency represented in specialized Ethereum smart contracts following an ""ERC20"" standard. Ziggurat Tokens enable participants to interact with Ziggurat’s Ecex.Exchange marketplace services, as storage, content, and data are obtained with Ziggurat Tokens as partly a payment mechanism. First partnership access – Ziggurat Tokens ownership will give access to advanced platform’s features. Second, assignors and assignees on Ecex.Exchange trading platform rewarded with a Ziggurats bonus if they make a certain volume. Third, every time Ecex.Exchange receives an assignment for trading platform, the customer will be rewarded with Ziggurat tokens.

Assignment of rights under a contract is the complete transfer of the rights to receive the benefits accruing to one of the parties to that contract. For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for €100, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.  Let's take the step further. Assume that Party C put the obligation on the Party B to Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and he/she want this obligation sell and price is €50. He/She log in and put the asking price to €50 and sent the notification to other parties and the market that he or she has assignments for sale. Let assume that Party B receives the info and he/or she make the counteroffer and put the price on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, let's say €40. Maybe they agree on €45.  As we see there is the great possibility to ease the situation of the debtor while allowing the parties to solve more delicate financing problems more flexible. The main idea here is that the debtor can always log on to the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and bid on the specific claim against which he is a debtor.

Concept description 3 - 10 sentences:  The market for claims exists in various ways and there is nothing new about an electronic stock market either. We are going to mix existing ideas with existing ecosystems, even step into systems through existing channels and to bring certain possibilities to market attention. The regular item that everybody trades is a buy-sell agreement. It is very easy to understand, every investor can buy stock and assume that what is happening behind the electronic market system, how the trade matching takes place and what are the consequences in the accounts when the deals are finally closed. An ecosystem which is mostly the same as stock market and built only for claims, rights, and receivables, operates on the basis of assignment agreement, has a great opportunity to spread around the world and to gain customers everywhere.  How does the project create value to the ecosystem and differs from competing projects:  Ziggurat Tokens represents a decentralized virtual currency represented in specialized Ethereum smart contracts following an ""ERC20"" standard. Ziggurat Tokens enable participants to interact with Ziggurat’s Ecex.Exchange marketplace services, as storage, content, and data are obtained with Ziggurat Tokens as partly a payment mechanism. First partnership access – Ziggurat Tokens ownership will give access to advanced platform’s features. Second, assignors and assignees on Ecex.Exchange trading platform rewarded with a Ziggurats bonus if they make a certain volume. Third, every time Ecex.Exchange receives an assignment for trading platform, the customer will be rewarded with Ziggurat tokens.

But as an entrepreneur and investor ourselves, we have to do our jobs with the best knowledge about ecosystems and we have to give our best skills to achieve results.  Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform idea is raised from the deep knowledge about personal loan market and the use of assigning loans to other entity.  There is in the market startups who try to divide loans into peases and sell them as small investments on marketplaces. It is the solution but there is very little business for investors. Our solutions bring bid and ask possibilities and the familiar trading environment for all investors because it is hard to think that investor has never seen the stock market trader. And it is the first big benefit, the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform trading environment is familiar to investors.  Then, of course, the assignment. We published several articles about the cessio, assignment, assignor, assignee, debtor, transfer of right .. and so on. Our goal is to explain to future Ziggurat token buyers what our Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is all about.

EETP users will be very different economic agents who willing to perform the very different set of agreements. EETP blueprints show us, trading systems are meant for various universal agreements based on assignments from antic cession agreement logic and that there are possibilities to use EETP that all future exploitation is impossible to present. Here is little overview and examples what private person and companies can do with EETP.  1.Private person.  The simplest problem for the private person is personal loans and loan agreement.  Assume that Private Person wants to take a loan 5000 euros. The easiest use is to sell loan agreement against her/himself on EETP. It means loan buyer is lender and lender can bee assignor and sell loan forward trough stocklike bid/ask system. Byer is assignee and Private person loan is on a free market. Everybody can buy it through EETP.  A private person can, of course, be assignor and sell all her/his assignments on EETP. The process is very simple.Private person log to EETP, there will be Jumio like identification, after that  she/he downloading all assignment related documents to digital container, read NDA and assignment agreement, put the price to assignment and after the submitting data the assignment is on EETP and  Private person role is assignor and her/his assignment is on market.    A private person can as assignee to find the financier for temporary bills or other loan agreements that she/he have to pay. Adding documents to assignment digital container and put the price Privat person can sell all different obligations her/herself.   2. Company  Mostly same thing as the private person: Thin about possibilities, then the company can sell loans and banks and credit companies have to buy them through simple assignment agreements. Keep in mind that loan agreements and other related documents are in the digital container and belong to assignment agreement. Assignee determine the provisions and assignor have to agree if assignor want to buy  and all this takes place in the marketplace , there mostly the same picture as stack market only instruments are assignments.  3. Financial institutions.  Let say that Italia gets busted. There are hundred banks, wanting to sell the loan agreements and the only way is by phone to find the old classmate in China and try to pitch the quality of distress loan portfolio. EETP have the solution. Italian bank can but as assignor all loans to one digital container and spread the selling information through EETP to possible buyers and even give in ask side indicative offer. And maybe there will be in ten minutes the deal and the unknown for Italian bank manager Soul credit company bought all loans.  https://ico.ecex.exchange/     ",False

A business who provides supplies or services to a company or an individual and does not demand payment immediately is also considered a creditor, based on the fact that the client owes the business money for services already rendered. Creditors can be classified as either personal or real. People who loan money to friends or family are personal creditors. Real creditors such as banks or finance companies have legal contracts with the borrower, sometimes granting the lender the right to claim any of the debtor's real assets (e.g. real estate or cars) if he fails to pay back the loan. Simply, creditors make money by charging interest on the loans they offer their clients. For example, if a creditor lends a borrower $5,000 with a 5% interest rate, the lender makes money due to the interest on the loan. In turn, the creditor accepts a degree of risk that the borrower may not repay the loan. To mitigate risk, most creditors index their interest rates or fees to the borrower's creditworthiness and past credit history. Thus, being a responsible borrower could save you a substantial sum, particularly if you are taking out a large loan, like a mortgage. Interest rates for mortgages vary based on a myriad of factors, including the size of the down payment and the lender itself; however, one's creditworthiness has a primary impact one one's interest rate.  Assignment Long story short creditor is the owner of rights and these rights are on a form of written contract. This written contract is the object of the next contract – assignment.    Contract assignment. A contract assignment means that a party to the contract assigns the entire contract to another party. This means that the party gives the obligations and benefits of an existing contract to another party. This situation occurs when a party to a contract wants another party to completely step in and fulfill the contract. The ability to assign a contract to another party is a fairly common practice in contracts law. This type of assignment is common in a wide variety of different contract situations.  Assignment of Rights There is also a second type of assignment. Sometimes, an assignor will only make an assignment of rights. This means that the original party remains obligated to fulfill the contract, but another party receives the contractual benefits.  Assignor and Assignee An assignor can be an individual, a group, or a business. The assignor is the party that transfers its contractual rights to another party. In a contract assignment, this means that the party transfers both the contractual obligations and the contractual benefits. In an assignment of rights, this means that the party transfers just the benefit of the contract. The assignee is the party that receives the rights and obligations under the contract, but wasn't an original party to the contract. Usually, an assignee receives the contract rights and obligations directly from an original party to the contract.  Obligor and Obligee An obligor is a party that is obligated to do something under the terms of a contract. You will sometimes hear the term 'obligor' used to describe a 'borrower' or a 'debtor.'

Receivables market is mostly human trading. Electronic trading platforms for receivables, like stock exchanges, do not exist. There are some entrepreneurs and startups, the trading platforms are eBay-like online invoice trading and human-backed excel-based systems. There are no direct connections to investors. PlanetZiggurat goal is to bring assignments on Ecex.Exchange trading platform. We will fill the gap by creating a market environment, a system for an active trading platform of assignment agreements. This means changing for owners of a multitude of agreements and documents, such as claims, invoices and factoring agreements etc. The market system will be similar to the stock market – very transparent and fast and it will allow trading claims, invoices from the moment they are being issued until the payment date. Claims, invoices will be traded until the obligations are either met or erased due to bankruptcy or natural end of the issuer. The owner of the invoice or claim can delist his right any moment (and exercise his right to realize their own requirements). As all traders know, all markets function through leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. All traders want to be close to possibilities that allow them to make fast decisions and take actions directly, using market data and trading terminals. PlanetZiggurat will spread all relevant trading data to leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. We will make arrangements that will get the existing investor community connected to the new assignment market. Blockchain technology can be used to verify transactions using a third party. There are three tools planned: 1. The trading platform, exchange for claims, invoices and others subjects for assignments (all together assignments) 2. Exchange information flow through leading brokerage community. PlanetZiggurat will launch a trading platform to show and teach members and clients, https://ecex.exchange/  and https://planetziggurat.com/ 3. Blockchain, especially digital signature (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/)  PlanetZiggurat will start on the Estonian market due to the small size of the country as a test market and relatively high level of IT development in the country. This will allow to get a functional system up an running fast, have the system compatible with EU regulations and use a small market as a test site for further development in order to be able upscale in full range and functionality at bigger markets at the right time The stock exchange in Estonia is very small. There are 50 000 trades per year, the depository and market systems are designed for small volumes and are relatively cheap. PlanetZiggurat knows the involved persons and companies and is planning to build its systems with the same software and legal background. http://www.nasdaqbaltic.com/market/?lang=en PlanetZigurrat has an arrangement with an advisory company (http://bda.ee/en/) who will help to harmonize the system with legislation. This business plan, PlanetZiggurat OÜ Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform whitepaper, attempts to fill the gap described by European Commission Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union “DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY MARKETS FOR NON-PERFORMING LOANS AND DISTRESSED ASSETS AND PROTECTION OF SECURED CREDITORS FROM BORROWERS’ DEFAULT “ https://ico.ecex.exchange/",False

Assignor is the role meant that this role can be filled in every person and the even debtor can introduce her/his dept. A Trading Platform can also introduce divestitures of the claim into the debtor, which means that the debtor can place the sales claims against her/him.This option turns the whole loan-giving logic around.In real life, this means that borrowers place their divestitures of claims against her/himself on the Trading Platform and wait for lender offers. They can put the price that they hope and the lenders have to fight to get the deal. Visual picture is like the stock market, but the instruments are different.

For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for €100, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.  Let's take the step further. Assume that Party C put the obligation on the Party B to Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and he/she want this obligation sell and price is €50. He/She log in and put the asking price to €50 and sent the notification to other parties and the market that HE or she has assignments for sale. Let assume that Party B receives the info and he/or She make the counteroffer and put the price on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, let's say €40. Maybe they agree on €45.  As we see there is the great possibility to ease the situation of the debtor while allowing the parties to solve more delicate financing problems more flexibly. The main idea here is that the debtor can always log on to the Ecex.Exchange Tradin Platform and bid on the specific claim against which he is a debtor. The creditor and the debtor are both Ecex.Exchange Tradin Platform significant customers in addition to investors who are interested in mediation.   https://ico.ecex.exchange/ico-details/",False

For many companies, utility appears to be an afterthought, but for a token to be successfully adopted into the community, it is the most critical component. With the amount of tokens on the market today, and new ones being launched every day, it’s clear there is a bubble, though the size of it might be debatable.” https://www.coindesk.com/defining-word-tokens-2018/  Shawn Wilkinson from Coindesk argued 3 ways companies have to create they utility Tokens and we tried to connect dots  and show that our Ziggurat Token is 100% utility Tokens.  The first argument is about purchasing services. PlanetZiggurat issued tokens mainly for two reasons. First is about collecting financing for future development and second is to find useful way connect service buyers to our Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform. „Purchasing services with tokens accelerates the time it takes for a transaction to settle, it makes purchasing services easier and adds an element of privacy as well. In the beginning, when the company is scaling and spending more money than they are making, the volume of tokens exchanged for the purchase of services will be minimal, but as the company’s revenues grow, so will the token transfer rate. You don’t need to require tokens to purchase services, but providing the option (and possibly providing a discount for doing so) can go a long way in driving the use of your token.”  The second argument is about the create a self-sustainable ecosystem. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is developed exactly for solutions like using utility Tokens. Trading Platform is using ethereum smart contract solutions, allowed client make transactions with different money and coin solutions ethereum, bitcoin and free market Tokens included. We will create a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers, facilitating transactions utilizing Ziggurat token and we create a self-sustaining ecosystem that is based on transacting our Ziggurat token.  The third argument is about automated smart contract payments. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform will definitely use smart contract but our first option is to use them to approve contracts. There will be several NDA agreements what have to be approved besides the main assignment agreement contract and ethereum smart contract solution giving us that possibility. We do not rule out automated smart contract payments entirely, but our business model fundamental agreement take place between our client and we have only advisable and deliberative role. Automated payments capabilities can be used on our Trading Platform regarding trading service fees and on same side-products as phone payments or wallet services.   The conclusion is that Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform Ziggurat Tokens fit well into the definition of the utility token.",False

Though the initial target of the platform is debts related (https://ico.ecex.exchange/ecex-exchange-trading-platform-as-a-debtor-tool/)  the platform in development is in it's core universal. It could handle cryptocurrency, standard shares, or some future instruments not even know at the moment. From the staring moment, we have to keep in mind in development that it will be a global project, not targeted to single country or market. This will bring on another level of complexity. We will use where possible several ready products and services what will need obtaining licenses to proceed. Of course, also additional customization and integration are needed. The system will provide Investor Services, Issuer Service, Participant Services, Clearing, and Settlement. It will be compatible with international standards like ISO data handling and messaging standards, TARGET2, Swift and others. System Will have API and Data Feed for integrating third-party users and services. The public ICO amount is actually 66% so about 33M. Even projects are usually not public you can get some idea from this public document on internet: Egyptian Central Bank Clearing & Settlement Depositary System (CSD) for Government Securities   https://www.google.ee/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjc2LyRwcDXAhVoOJoKHYPWDAYQFgglMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.menatransitionfund.org%2Fsites%2Fmena_trans_fund%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2FEG%2520EBRD%2520Central%2520Bank%2520CSD%2520for%2520Govt%2520Securities%2520Proposal_0.docx&usg=AOvVaw16X1ooYJedLYFvS139BpJ2 where project cost for STANDARD market and SINGLE country is estimated to 6.7M Because of global approach we expect to get signifficant benefit. We acknowledge that for classical instruments there can be market limitations from region to region, but initial target is to bring out totally new debt market model. The fact the we will be able to trade any share, cryptocurrency or other instrument is extra bonus. Also it is possible that one day cryptocurrencies are regulated as traditional financial instrumens. If this daycomes then we would like to be ready to offer this service.  We will not know the outcome of ICO, but we are committed to continue. With low resources it just takes more time and intermediate steps what can be skipped with sufficient funding. Last but not least - this type of financial world is at the moment very closed circle and we would like to give much simpler and cheaper access to wider audience.  ",False

But here some visions:   Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform (EETP) clients vision.   EETP users will be very different economic agents who willing to perform the very different set of agreements. EETP blueprints show us, trading systems are meant for various universal agreements based on assignments from antic cession agreement logic and that there are possibilities to use EETP that all future exploitation is impossible to present. Here is little overview and examples what private person and companies can do with EETP.  1.Private person.  The simplest problem for the private person is personal loans and loan agreement.  Assume that Private Person wants to take a loan 5000 euros. The easiest use is to sell loan agreement against her/himself on EETP. It means loan buyer is lender and lender can bee assignor and sell loan forward trough stocklike bid/ask system. Byer is assignee and Private person loan is on a free market. Everybody can buy it through EETP.  A private person can, of course, be assignor and sell all her/his assignments on EETP. The process is very simple.Private person log to EETP, there will be Jumio like identification, after that  she/he downloading all assignment related documents to digital container, read NDA and assignment agreement, put the price to assignment and after the submitting data the assignment is on EETP and  Private person role is assignor and her/his assignment is on market.   A private person can as assignee to find the financier for temporary bills or other loan agreements that she/he have to pay. Adding documents to assignment digital container and put the price Privat person can sell all different obligations her/herself.   2. Company  Mostly same thing as the private person: Thin about possibilities, then the company can sell loans and banks and credit companies have to buy them through simple assignment agreements. Keep in mind that loan agreements and other related documents are in the digital container and belong to assignment agreement. Assignee determine the provisions and assignor have to agree if assignor want to buy  and all this takes place in the marketplace , there mostly the same picture as stack market only instruments are assignments.  3. Financial institutions.  Let say that Italia gets busted. There are hundred banks, wanting to sell the loan agreements and the only way is by phone to find the old classmate in China and try to pitch the quality of distress loan portfolio. EETP have the solution. Italian bank can but as assignor all loans to one digital container and spread the selling information through EETP to possible buyers and even give in ask side indicative offer. And maybe there will be in ten minutes the deal and the unknown for Italian bank manager Soul credit company bought all loans.   [/quote]  Thank you for reply, but permit me to doubt, private persons are not your targeted audience (if you want me to express my opinion on that, just give me a sign) That's why your project sounds and looks too sophisticated to forum's inhabitants. Ordinary people doesn't interact with loans, assignments and etc. selling everyday (I wonder if ever) whilst financial institutions are your clients for sure. To hit that market you need much more complex approach and some serious backing (fundamental investors, maybe government approval), IMO      [/quote] So far, this Ecex Exchange Trading Platform is the most interesting and best project that i have seen. The project team definitely deserve a round of applause with a standby champagne to celebrate their great success soon! Well done!",False

Cessio's legislation is similar in essential legal systems.I agree, it's hard to understand, but I hope that serious investors will understand. I am affiliated with credit companies and I am well aware of the needs of both individuals and business people.       For learning and understanding.  1. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF ASSIGNMENT  1.1.Roman Law  The Roman law provides an invaluable introduction to the understanding of legal concepts and a passport to the appreciation of Continental legal systems. Roman law is the product of the genius of good order and organized common sense of a remarkable ancient civilization, and it constitutes a legacy that has had a profound influence in subsequent ages.   1.2. Cessio   There are  two main institutes related to cessio:   - cessio bonorum: where a debtor had become insolvent owing to unforeseen circumstances, he could, under the formulary procedure, avoid the infamy attached to execution by petitioning a magistrate to allow him to make a voluntary cession of his property (cessio bonorum) to his creditors;  - cessio in iure: Litt. cession before a court. It was a ritual procedure (imitating the procedure of the legis actio sacramento in rem) already known by the time of the Twelve Tables that was used to create, transfer or extinguish certain rights (specifically the so-called ?Quiritary rights?). It partly fell into disuse in classical Roman law.1.  Cessio bonorum, (Latin: ?a cession of goods?), a voluntary surrender of goods by a debtor to his creditors. It did not amount to a discharge of the debt unless the property ceded was sufficient for the purpose, but it secured the debtor from personal arrest. The creditors sold the goods, applying the proceeds to their claims. Although property that the debtor might acquire later could be claimed by the creditors, he could not be deprived of the bare necessities. The main features of cessio bonorum were adopted into the French and other legal systems. In England it survives in the internal regulations of certain commercial bodies, such as stock exchanges. Cessio bonorum ,was a procedure introduced by Augustus reign (Republic) , whereby a judgement debtor voluntarily surrendered his property to the creditors. The property was sold off, but the debtor would not be subjected to legal disgrace or to the possible imprisonment by the creditors. Surrender was not available as of the right: it applied only there the preator was satisfied that the debtor had genuine assets and that the bankruptcy was the result of misfortune.  In jure cessio was a conveyance in the form of a lawsuit. The transferee claimed before the magistrate that the thing was his, and the transferor, who was the defendant, admitted the claim. The magistrate then adjudged the thing to the transferee. (The sham-lawsuit theory, however, is not acceptable to all modern scholars, principally because the judgment of ownership was valid against any possible private claimant, not merely against the defendant, as in a true lawsuit.) 2 Cessio had some similarities to mancipatio. It was a highly formal and cumbersome conveyance, originating before the Twelve Tables and fading in importance long before Justinian. Our knowledge of cessio is derived mainly from Gaius, who tells us(Inst.Gai.2.24) that cessio was performed before a magistrate, such as the preator(or governor) with the transferor and transferee present, together with the property to be transferred (or a symbolic sod of earth in the case of land). The transferee grasped the property and uttered the same set words as in mancipatio. The preator asked the transferor thether he claimed the thing. Assuming that the latter stayed silent, or made no claim, he was taken as having ceded his rights, whereupon the preator awarded the property to the transferee.3  2. ASSIGNMENT  TODAY  An assignment (Latin cessio) is a term used with similar meanings in the law of contracts and in the law of real estate. In both instances, it encompasses the transfer of rights held by one party?the assignor?to another party?the assignee. It can also be a transfer of a benefit, including an equitable interest, according to established rules (at common law or in equity).The rights may be vested or contingent.The details of the assignment determine some additional rights and liabilities (or duties). Typically a third-party is involved in a contract with the assignor, and the contract is in effect transferred to the assignee. For example, a borrower borrows money from a local bank. The local bank receives a mortgage note and can thereafter transfer that note to a financial institution in exchange for a lump-sum of cash, thereby assigning the right to receive payment from the borrower to another entity. Mortgages and lending contracts are relatively amenable to assignment since the lender's duties are relatively limited; other contracts which involve personal duties such as legal counsel may not be assignable. The assignment might be claims, all kind of contracts, factoring contracts, receivables, the pool of loan contracts and so on. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform enables download all assignment related documents to the digital container under digital signature. It mean if assignment agreement is on the market buyer obtain all related documents and have full authority to realize his rights.  Assignment Wikipedia",False

For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for €100, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.  Let's take the step further. Assume that Party C put the obligation on the Party B to Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and he/she want this obligation sell and price is €50. He/She log in and put the asking price to €50 and sent the notification to other parties and the market that HE or she has assignments for sale. Let assume that Party B receives the info and he/or She make the counteroffer and put the price on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, let's say €40. Maybe they agree on €45.  As we see there is the great possibility to ease the situation of the debtor while allowing the parties to solve more delicate financing problems more flexibly. The main idea here is that the debtor can always log on to the Ecex.Exchange Tradin Platform and bid on the specific claim against which he is a debtor. The creditor and the debtor are both Ecex.Exchange Tradin Platform significant customers in addition to investors who are interested in mediation.",False

As I am reading this threads I have noticed that devs are being active in improving the project. I hope Zig will get more investors and I am hoping that your project will be successful.

But here some visions:   Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform (EETP) clients vision.   EETP users will be very different economic agents who willing to perform the very different set of agreements. EETP blueprints show us, trading systems are meant for various universal agreements based on assignments from antic cession agreement logic and that there are possibilities to use EETP that all future exploitation is impossible to present. Here is little overview and examples what private person and companies can do with EETP.  1.Private person.  The simplest problem for the private person is personal loans and loan agreement.  Assume that Private Person wants to take a loan 5000 euros. The easiest use is to sell loan agreement against her/himself on EETP. It means loan buyer is lender and lender can bee assignor and sell loan forward trough stocklike bid/ask system. Byer is assignee and Private person loan is on a free market. Everybody can buy it through EETP.  A private person can, of course, be assignor and sell all her/his assignments on EETP. The process is very simple.Private person log to EETP, there will be Jumio like identification, after that  she/he downloading all assignment related documents to digital container, read NDA and assignment agreement, put the price to assignment and after the submitting data the assignment is on EETP and  Private person role is assignor and her/his assignment is on market.    A private person can as assignee to find the financier for temporary bills or other loan agreements that she/he have to pay. Adding documents to assignment digital container and put the price Privat person can sell all different obligations her/herself.   2. Company  Mostly same thing as the private person: Thin about possibilities, then the company can sell loans and banks and credit companies have to buy them through simple assignment agreements. Keep in mind that loan agreements and other related documents are in the digital container and belong to assignment agreement. Assignee determine the provisions and assignor have to agree if assignor want to buy  and all this takes place in the marketplace , there mostly the same picture as stack market only instruments are assignments.  3. Financial institutions.  Let say that Italia gets busted. There are hundred banks, wanting to sell the loan agreements and the only way is by phone to find the old classmate in China and try to pitch the quality of distress loan portfolio. EETP have the solution. Italian bank can but as assignor all loans to one digital container and spread the selling information through EETP to possible buyers and even give in ask side indicative offer. And maybe there will be in ten minutes the deal and the unknown for Italian bank manager Soul credit company bought all loans.",False

Foreign investors have equal rights and obligations with local entrepreneurs. All foreign investors may establish a company and conduct business in Estonia in the same way as local investors; no restrictions apply. Estonia has concluded treaties for the protection of investments with 31 countries, including the USA, Germany, France, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. Also, agreements for avoiding double taxation have been made with 53 countries, including the EU. The legal system in Estonia is based on the Continental European civil law model and has been influenced by the German legal system. Unlike in common law countries, Estonia has detailed codifications and issues are solved according to those. Estonian law is basically divided into private and public law. Generally, private law consists of civil law and commercial law. The public law consists of international law, constitutional law, administrative law, criminal law, financial law and procedural law. Estonia has a three-level court system. County, city courts, and administrative courts adjudicate matters in the first instance. The majority of courts of the first instance are situated in county centers. The courts of the second instance hear the appeals against decisions of courts of the first instance. Courts of appeal are courts of the second instance (sometimes also called circuit courts). The courts of appeal are situated in Jõhvi, Tartu and Tallinn. The Supreme Court, situated in Tartu, is the court of the highest instance. A statement of claim is filed with the court of the first instance, an appeal to the court of the second instance and an appeal in cassation with the court of the third or the highest instance. A matter shall be heard in the Supreme Court only after all previous court instances have been passed. The filing of an appeal is governed by respective codes of court procedure.

Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, NPSs, banks.  Currently, world markets for distressed debt tend to be characterized by comparatively small trade volumes, a limited number of active investors and large bid-ask spreads. This might reflect various factors, such as significant differences in the required rates of return for banks and investors and in loan recovery expectations, and how servicing costs are taken into account. Ecex.Exchange understand how this market currently functions and gather information how could assist its further development. In particular, it is of interest to ascertain if there are specific the gap to fill that constrain the assignment of loans.(Ecex.Exchange expertise) The lack of independent servicing capacity in some markets may hinder the development of liquid secondary markets for loans and especially distressed debt. That kind of independent services Ecex.Exchange exactly propose. Furthermore, when banks and credit companies assign defaulted loans, third-party servicers as Ecex.Exchange  represents an alternative to manage those loans on behalf of investors, which usually do not have appropriate capacity to service NPLs.   2. Assignment of loans  Banks may assign performing or non-performing loans to outside investors in order to manage the composition of their balance sheet, their risks and to allow a potential business model re-orientation. Loan contracts can, in principle, be assigned from the originating creditor to a third-party investor under private law regimes. This is most often done via an assignment agreement with the new creditor, which takes over the original creditor's rights and obligations. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform is meant exactly for that kind of business.Banks will introduce NPLs on our platform and potential assignees will obtain the rights trough assignment agreement. Sales can contribute to strengthening banks’ balance sheets and their profitability in the medium to long-term, as the transferring bank would not incur the additional administrative expenses and potential additional losses related to the future management of the loans. In addition, removing NPLs from a bank's balance sheet reduces the uncertainty around the bank's asset quality and loan valuations, as uncertainty on possible future losses associated with the NPL portfolio disappears. In the short term, however, the assignment of NPLs might in some cases stress the bank's capital position and raise concerns regarding the viability of the bank. In some cases, assignee of NPL contracts, including non-banks, may be more effective in recovering value, in particular through the potential use of better management and servicing. Especially some smaller banks may lack the required in-house capacities and internal processes to manage large portfolios of non-performing loans. Moreover, banks and non-bank investors may face a different set of incentives and constraints when managing loans. Banks may be more reluctant to restructure loans to avoid moral hazard and so-called strategic defaults of existing borrowers. Today an important aspect of the functioning of secondary markets for NPLs are the large bid-ask spreads. Ecex.Exchange will reduce spreads and it decreases uncertainties about future cash flows, information asymmetries between assignors and assignees and also first-mover disadvantages/ coordination challenges. Together, these factors may significantly constrain the price discovery process. Potential assignees tend not to have access to reliable, granular, readily available standardized information on asset quality and loan tapes in banks. As a consequence, potential assignees may in some cases offer a price that does not reflect the value of portfolios for sale, thus hindering potential transactions.However, Ecex.Exchange provides stock market like price possibilities and assignors and assignees will present they best prices and wills and it is nature of the business that at some point prices are suitable for both parties.     3.Ziggurat Tokens  https://ico.ecex.exchange/  Ziggurat tokens shall provide for the user, today's case the banks, opportunities to sell and buy assignments (NPLs) for certain prices. There is the example: All service fees are for Ziggurat Token holders payable with Ziggurat Tokens. Let assume that assignment cost is 20 EUR. Ziggurat Tokens holder will pay 20 Ziggurats. Let assume that guest service fee is 50 EUR.Ziggurat Tokens holder will pay 50 Ziggurats. For paying for Exec.Exchange Trading Platform services Ziggurat Tokens can be used on exchange rate 1 ZIG  = 1 USD (this rate only Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform if paying for services.). We project our assignments amount several million, in the end, third year. It gives great opportunity trade tokens in free marketplaces or uses them on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform.The Ziggurat Tokens will be an integral part of the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform as a means to support and pay for the services on the Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform.",False

A Trading Platform can also introduce divestitures of the claim into the debtor, which means that the debtor can place the sales claims against her/him.This option turns the whole loan-giving logic around.In real life, this means that borrowers place their divestitures of claims against her/himself on the Trading Platform and wait for lender offers. They can put the price that they hope and the lenders have to fight to get the deal. Visual picture is like the stock market, but the instruments are different.

China and India typically dominate the conversation when looking at emerging economies in Asia, but Southeast Asia is rapidly being acknowledged as a market where the internet is changing daily behaviors and creating new opportunities. A lack of data has traditionally made it difficult to pinpoint that potential but Google and Singaporean sovereign fund Temasek today released an update to their highly-referenced 2015 ‘e-Conomy SEA’ report — the main takeaway is that growth has exceeded their initial expectations. The original report forecast Southeast Asia’s internet economy hitting $200 billion per year by 2025, but now it is estimated that it will top that number, reaching $50 billion in 2017 alone.",False

EETP users will be very different economic agents who willing to perform the very different set of agreements. EETP blueprints show us, trading systems are meant for various universal agreements based on assignments from antic cession agreement logic and that there are possibilities to use EETP that all future exploitation is impossible to present. Here is little overview and examples what private person and companies can do with EETP.  1.Private person.  The simplest problem for the private person is personal loans and loan agreement.  Assume that Private Person wants to take a loan 5000 euros. The easiest use is to sell loan agreement against her/himself on EETP. It means loan buyer is lender and lender can bee assignor and sell loan forward trough stock like bid/ask system. Byer is assignee and Private person loan is on a free market. Everybody can buy it through EETP.  A private person can, of course, be assignor and sell all her/his assignments on EETP. The process is very simple.Private person log to EETP, there will be Jumio like identification, after that  she/he downloading all assignment related documents to digital container, read NDA and assignment agreement, put the price to assignment and after the submitting data the assignment is on EETP and  Private person role is assignor and her/his assignment is on market.   A private person can as assignee to find the financier for temporary bills or other loan agreements that she/he have to pay. Adding documents to assignment digital container and put the price Privat person can sell all different obligations she/he owns.   2. Company  Mostly same thing as the private person: Then about possibilities, then the company can sell loans and banks and credit companies have to buy them through simple assignment agreements. Keep in mind that loan agreements and other related documents are in the digital container and belong to assignment agreement. Assignee determines the provisions and assignor have to agree if assignor wants to buy and all this takes place in the marketplace, there mostly the same picture as stock market only instruments are assignments.  3. Financial institutions.  Let say that Italia gets busted. There are a hundred banks, wanting to sell the loan agreements and the only way is by phone to find the old classmate in China and try to pitch the quality of distress loan portfolio. EETP have the solution. Italian bank can but as assignor all loans to one digital container and spread the selling information through EETP to possible buyers and even give in ask side indicative offer. And maybe there will be in ten minutes the deal and the unknown for Italian bank manager Soul credit company bought all loans.",False

For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for €100, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.  Let's take the step further. Assume that Party C put the obligation on the Party B to Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and he/she want this obligation sell and price is €50. He/She log in and put the asking price to €50 and sent the notification to other parties and the market that HE or she has assignments for sale. Let assume that Party B receives the info and he/or She make the counteroffer and put the price on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, let's say €40. Maybe they agree on €45.  As we see there is the great possibility to ease the situation of the debtor while allowing the parties to solve more delicate financing problems more flexibly. The main idea here is that the debtor can always log on to the Ecex.Exchange Tradin Platform and bid on the specific claim against which he is a debtor.

Foreign investors have equal rights and obligations with local entrepreneurs. All foreign investors may establish a company and conduct business in Estonia in the same way as local investors; no restrictions apply. Estonia has concluded treaties for the protection of investments with 31 countries, including the USA, Germany, France, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. Also, agreements for avoiding double taxation have been made with 53 countries, including the EU. The legal system in Estonia is based on the Continental European civil law model and has been influenced by the German legal system. Unlike in common law countries, Estonia has detailed codifications and issues are solved according to those. Estonian law is basically divided into private and public law. Generally, private law consists of civil law and commercial law. The public law consists of international law, constitutional law, administrative law, criminal law, financial law and procedural law. Estonia has a three-level court system. County, city courts, and administrative courts adjudicate matters in the first instance. The majority of courts of the first instance are situated in county centers. The courts of the second instance hear the appeals against decisions of courts of the first instance. Courts of appeal are courts of the second instance (sometimes also called circuit courts). The courts of appeal are situated in Jõhvi, Tartu and Tallinn. The Supreme Court, situated in Tartu, is the court of the highest instance. A statement of claim is filed with the court of the first instance, an appeal to the court of the second instance and an appeal in cassation with the court of the third or the highest instance. A matter shall be heard in the Supreme Court only after all previous court instances have been passed. The filing of an appeal is governed by respective codes of court procedure.

For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for €100, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous or previous owner.  Let's take the step further. Assume that Party C put the obligation on the Party B to Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform and he/she want this obligation sell and price is €50. He/She log in and put the asking price to €50 and sent the notification to other parties and the market that HE or she has assignments for sale. Let assume that Party B receives the info and he/or She make the counteroffer and put the price on Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform, let's say €40. Maybe they agree on €45.  As we see there is the great possibility to ease the situation of the debtor while allowing the parties to solve more delicate financing problems more flexibly. The main idea here is that the debtor can always log on to the Ecex.Exchange Tradin Platform and bid on the specific claim against which he is a debtor.

Receivables market is mostly human trading. Electronic trading platforms for receivables, like stock exchanges, do not exist. There are some entrepreneurs and startups, the trading platforms are eBay-like online invoice trading and human-backed excel-based systems. There are no direct connections to investors. PlanetZiggurat goal is to bring assignments on Ecex.Exchange trading platform. We will fill the gap by creating a market environment, a system for an active trading platform of assignment agreements. This means changing for owners of a multitude of agreements and documents, such as claims, invoices and factoring agreements etc. The market system will be similar to the stock market – very transparent and fast and it will allow trading claims, invoices from the moment they are being issued until the payment date. Claims, invoices will be traded until the obligations are either met or erased due to bankruptcy or natural end of the issuer. The owner of the invoice or claim can delist his right any moment (and exercise his right to realize their own requirements). As all traders know, all markets function through leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms. All traders want to be close to possibilities that allow them to make fast decisions and take actions directly, using market data and trading terminals. PlanetZiggurat will spread all relevant trading data to leading brokerage firms and online brokerage firms.

The Chinese law also recognizes the assignment of contractual rights and regards it as a change of parties to the contract. In essence, under Chinese law, assignment of contractual rights means that the parties to a duly formed contract may assign their contractual rights to a third person without changing the terms of the contract.22 Article 79 of the Chinese Contract Law provides that the obligee may assign all or part of its contractual rights to a third party. Chinese law allows the obligee to assign its contractual rights to a third party as long as the assignment does not violate law or social ethics. The underlying rationale is that the assignment of contracts may encourage transactions and promote the development of the market economy. However, in order to protect the public interest and maintain an orderly marketplace, as well as to balance the rights and interests of both parties, Chinese law also limits the scope of the assignment of contractual rights.23 According to Chinese law, there are three situations in which the contractual rights are not assignable: First, if the nature of the contractual rights makes them un-assignable, then the contractual rights may not be assigned to a third party.

This means changing of owners of a multitude of agreements and documents, such as claims, invoices and factoring agreements all together assignments. The regular thing what everybody trading is buy-sell agreement. It is very easy to understand, every investor can buy stock and he assumed that is happening behind the electronic market system, how the trade matching takes place and what is the consequences in account then the deals are finally ended. But in the ecosystem which is mostly same as the stock market and built only for claims, rights, and receivables, operates on basis assignment agreement, there are great possibilities spread around the world and win the customers everywhere. PlanetZiggurat is aiming for 1 million trades per day by the end of the third year. Our revenue will come from services including: trading fees, issuer background check systems, digital signing, exchange member fees etc. The cash flow will be similar to stock exchange business. The only difference will be instruments and a set of agreements.   Ziggurat Tokens The PlanetZiggurat shall grant to the User an opportunity to use the Ziggurat digital tokens to: (i)opportunities to pay partly for service to sell and buy  claims, receivables, and mediate insurance contracts, (ii) to pay partly various support services related to the selling and buying through the exchange, and give users exercise right to realize their own requirements regarding claims, (iii) Ziggurat cryptocurrency grants the right to profit from up to 20% of Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform outcome, (distribution will be in cryptocurrency, in ethereum until otherwise decided), (iv) using Ziggurat cryptocurrency for internal payments through the Ecex.Exchange Platform. The smart-contract of the Ecex.Exchange Platform requires the Ziggurat digital tokens for its work. Only the owner of the Ziggurat digital tokens may purchase with discounts the services of the Ecex.Exchange Platform.       For learning and understanding.  1. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF ASSIGNMENT  1.1.Roman Law  The Roman law provides an invaluable introduction to the understanding of legal concepts and a passport to the appreciation of Continental legal systems. Roman law is the product of the genius of good order and organized common sense of a remarkable ancient civilization, and it constitutes a legacy that has had a profound influence in subsequent ages.   1.2. Cessio   There are  two main institutes related to cessio:  - cessio bonorum: where a debtor had become insolvent owing to unforeseen circumstances, he could, under the formulary procedure, avoid the infamy attached to execution by petitioning a magistrate to allow him to make a voluntary cession of his property (cessio bonorum) to his creditors;  - cessio in iure: Litt. cession before a court. It was a ritual procedure (imitating the procedure of the legis actio sacramento in rem) already known by the time of the Twelve Tables that was used to create, transfer or extinguish certain rights (specifically the so-called ?Quiritary rights?). It partly fell into disuse in classical Roman law.1.  Cessio bonorum, (Latin: ?a cession of goods?), a voluntary surrender of goods by a debtor to his creditors. It did not amount to a discharge of the debt unless the property ceded was sufficient for the purpose, but it secured the debtor from personal arrest. The creditors sold the goods, applying the proceeds to their claims. Although property that the debtor might acquire later could be claimed by the creditors, he could not be deprived of the bare necessities. The main features of cessio bonorum were adopted into the French and other legal systems. In England it survives in the internal regulations of certain commercial bodies, such as stock exchanges. Cessio bonorum ,was a procedure introduced by Augustus reign (Republic) , whereby a judgement debtor voluntarily surrendered his property to the creditors. The property was sold off, but the debtor would not be subjected to legal disgrace or to the possible imprisonment by the creditors. Surrender was not available as of the right: it applied only there the preator was satisfied that the debtor had genuine assets and that the bankruptcy was the result of misfortune.  In jure cessio was a conveyance in the form of a lawsuit. The transferee claimed before the magistrate that the thing was his, and the transferor, who was the defendant, admitted the claim. The magistrate then adjudged the thing to the transferee. (The sham-lawsuit theory, however, is not acceptable to all modern scholars, principally because the judgment of ownership was valid against any possible private claimant, not merely against the defendant, as in a true lawsuit.) 2 Cessio had some similarities to mancipatio. It was a highly formal and cumbersome conveyance, originating before the Twelve Tables and fading in importance long before Justinian. Our knowledge of cessio is derived mainly from Gaius, who tells us(Inst.Gai.2.24) that cessio was performed before a magistrate, such as the preator(or governor) with the transferor and transferee present, together with the property to be transferred (or a symbolic sod of earth in the case of land). The transferee grasped the property and uttered the same set words as in mancipatio. The preator asked the transferor thether he claimed the thing. Assuming that the latter stayed silent, or made no claim, he was taken as having ceded his rights, whereupon the preator awarded the property to the transferee.3  2. ASSIGNMENT  TODAY  An assignment (Latin cessio) is a term used with similar meanings in the law of contracts and in the law of real estate. In both instances, it encompasses the transfer of rights held by one party?the assignor?to another party?the assignee. It can also be a transfer of a benefit, including an equitable interest, according to established rules (at common law or in equity).The rights may be vested or contingent.The details of the assignment determine some additional rights and liabilities (or duties). Typically a third-party is involved in a contract with the assignor, and the contract is in effect transferred to the assignee. For example, a borrower borrows money from a local bank. The local bank receives a mortgage note and can thereafter transfer that note to a financial institution in exchange for a lump-sum of cash, thereby assigning the right to receive payment from the borrower to another entity. Mortgages and lending contracts are relatively amenable to assignment since the lender's duties are relatively limited; other contracts which involve personal duties such as legal counsel may not be assignable. The assignment might be claims, all kind of contracts, factoring contracts, receivables, the pool of loan contracts and so on. Ecex.Exchange Trading Platform enables download all assignment related documents to the digital container under digital signature. It mean if assignment agreement is on the market buyer obtain all related documents and have full authority to realize his rights.

EETP blueprints show us, trading systems are meant for various universal agreements based on assignments from antic cession agreement logic and that there are possibilities to use EETP that all future exploitation is impossible to present. Here is little overview and examples what private person and companies can do with EETP.  1.Private person  The simplest problem for the private person is personal loans and loan agreement.  Assume that Private Person wants to take a loan 5000 euros. The easiest use is to sell loan agreement against her/himself on EETP. It means loan buyer is lender and lender can bee assignor and sell loan forward trough stocklike bid/ask system. Byer is assignee and Private person loan is on a free market. Everybody can buy it through EETP.  A private person can, of course, be assignor and sell all her/his assignments on EETP. The process is very simple.Private person log to EETP, there will be Jumio like identification, after that  she/he downloading all assignment related documents to digital container, read NDA and assignment agreement, put the price to assignment and after the submitting data the assignment is on EETP and  Private person role is assignor and her/his assignment is on market.    A private person can as assignee to find the financier for temporary bills or other loan agreements that she/he have to pay. Adding documents to assignment digital container and put the price Privat person can sell all different obligations her/herself.   2. Company  Mostly same thing as the private person: Thin about possibilities, then the company can sell loans and banks and credit companies have to buy them through simple assignment agreements. Keep in mind that loan agreements and other related documents are in the digital container and belong to assignment agreement. Assignee determine the provisions and assignor have to agree if assignor want to buy  and all this takes place in the marketplace, there mostly the same picture as stack market only instruments are assignments.  3. Financial institutions  Let say that Italia gets busted. There are a hundred banks, wanting to sell the loan agreements and the only way is by phone to find the old classmate in China and try to pitch the quality of distress loan portfolio. EETP have the solution. Italian bank can but as assignor all loans to one digital container and spread the selling information through EETP to possible buyers and even give in ask side indicative offer. And maybe there will be in ten minutes the deal and the unknown for Italian bank manager Soul credit company bought all loans.  SALE CONTRACT INFO  https://ico.ecex.exchange/ico-details/",False

The primary goal of Ecex Exchange is to make global and universal exchange of  any kind dept related instruments (claims, assignments, cessio - there are many names and it depends on country ). It is missing at the moment and we see it from personal experience that demand for this type of service exists.  BUT as a ""side product"" we will build Depository and Trading system what is capable of handling any kind of security instruments. Is it also capable of trading any cryptocurrency - no doubt if it will be set up so. Is it capable of providing private ledger for some special kind of cryptocurrencty / token holders - no problem. Is it capable of providing ICO services - no problem, IPO is supported out of the box and ICO is just a special flavor of it. etc. etc.  Our own token Ziggurat - is it crucial mandatory part of the system? Most likely not, we will use it in some areas, but in parallel other payment options and cryptos will be valid. And it is also the beauty of the system symbiosis of ""old"" and ""new"" economy. ZIG token will give all ICO participants possibility to profit from Ecex Exchange project and this there are no huge minimum limits like in case of classical finance scheme. As many of the building blocks are from ""old world"" the risks are significantly lower than building 100% new product from zero.",False
