We are so sorry that took long enough to update, rare news update doesnt mean there is no progress, often we confuse what to update and wondering+amaze how all other top projects have so many speculated news(even if the funding is million dolars development still takes time, you cant hurry the code and ideas); most of our child-projects are still under construction and the complexity of each projects, and small regular development fund we had are demanding more time for results (Thou some are in live construction).  Meanwhile working on it, we are observing market price and poloniex-margin in worried, hope for ETH DASH DGB XEM could rebound very soon (this is where our major development funding where it is stored and traded, apart from so many other burned due to got delisted by poloniex centralize exchange; these funding are not the regular basis income from the car rental, in which most of it return to buy wall of $FRAS at the market, ""the founder team do not take salaries been for few months, prioritizing crew sallary and cost"") We are commited to these projects and be responsible, we try hard not to let down our backers.  Hope for the best that Bitcoin do not storm-raging and kills all other crypto-projects in general, since alt-coins contribute to tons of job creations and tokenize economy, other projects doesnt always get development funding in the form of Bitcoin and they still need to pay sallaries regularly, not to mention cost, etc.  To alt-coins, this whole 2018 and until this month of 2019 is the worst for creativity and production. If this is keep going on, then there is no need to create projects and build cryptocurrency ecosystem anymore, and people might only hold bitcoin alone(maybe no need to work) and when the creativity +production and economy is dead, i forsaw bitcoin alone is pointless. Maybe dark days ahead as potrayed by time-traveller guy.",False

Also it has a DEX which allow you to trade amongst 95% bitcoin base projects as well as ERC20 tokens. By having your coin on KMD asset chain, your coin will have it's very own chain, not like ethereum where every project is dependent on ethereum chain. And everytime a new project adds new features on an asset chain. Those features can easily be replicated and shares among all coins on komodo platform. To build your project on KMD asset chain , it could be as simple as typing two line of codes , but it is customizable for each project. Since each project has it's own chain, scaling it's no longer an issue. The latest news is KMD is preparing for 1 millions TPS. So this a preview of KMD platform.

Fras Coin has been set up to be usable by multiple blockhain platforms. There is a notice from Frasindo that Ardor and Ignis trade has opened on their platform. Ignis is a chain-child crypto created or ICOed on 5 August 2017. Ignis became the first child chain on the blocked network of Ardor suspected of having the entire NXT feature, but there is a special addition to Ardor-Specific. Simply put, Ignis has all the advantages of NXT coupled with better perfection. Ardor itself is a parent blockchain that enables the addition of derived chains by the mechanism of transaction processing through Proof-of-Stake Consensus (POS). This mechanism ensures the security and scalability of the underlying network chain. Transaction fees on a derivative chain will be paid with the Original Token.  To make this scheme easier to understand let us take the example, Ardor as a parent blockchain was released in the third quarter of 2017 ago. However, users in the blocking ecosystem of Ardor are able to maintain accounts with balances across various derivative chains. Thus, by having 1 Ardor account, users can save money on various other derivative chains without having to bother to change the chain. Then the Ardor derivative chain is a new technology and does not represent a Sidechains approach like Lisk or Rootstock. Cross-chain / cross-chain transactions can be done very easily, because the derived chains are closely integrated in the Ardor parent chain.  This is where Ignis was created as the First Derived Chain of the Ardor blocking ecosystem. Ignis will be the only unrelated derivative chain... ...

I took the example in Go-Car and Uber:  Go-Car is an application-based online taxi service application owned by startup Gojek, Go-Car was first introduced in 2016 where car | four-wheeled vehicles that can be used is a private vehicle with black plate. Regarding the tariff per kilometer, Go-Car uses government regulation at Rp 2,500 per kilometer with the top tariff of Rp 6,500. Now Go-Car service has been present in 10 major cities of Jakarta, Jabodetabek, Sukabumi, Padang, Banjarmasin, Jambi, Pontianak and several other cities.

Basically, a digital payment platform like PayPal is an intermediary between two parties who will make transactions.This intermediary acts as a trusted party by both parties to verify the transaction, then register and transfer the funds from the first to the second party. This kind of PayPal digital payment platform is actually similar to interbank ATM transaction providers, such as “ATM Bersama”, Prima, Link, Cirrus, Alto or Maestro.Until 2009, a mysterious figure who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto, launched a digital payment platform with the name “Bitcoin”. There are at least two fundamental things that differentiate Bitcoin from traditional digital payment platforms like PayPal.  First, Paypal and the like are just intermediaries for electronic transactions using the common currency used everyday. As with any other international transaction, the currency standard generally accepted by the digital transaction platform is the US Dollar currency.While Bitcoin is a “currency”  in digital form, which is outside the currency system that is recognized and regulated by the world’s central bank. He has a fluctuating value. Currently the value of 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to USD 2,490. To have Bitcoin can be done in three ways: buy, get as payment, or do ‘mining’ or ‘mining’. Of course the mining here is not like we dredge the earth to mine gold. Mining to obtain Bitcoin is done by running a series of algorithms to solve a key used to verify a transaction.Second, Bitcoin transactions do not require a third party like Paypal, ATM Bersama and other it. To replace third parties, Bitcoin transactions are verified and recorded in an encrypted distributed system to ensure their security....................................................................... .. ... to Read More  https://www.frasindo.com/media/the-history-and-development-of-fras-coin-as-a-self-sustainable-blockchain-startup-incubator/",False

Currently the holiday is not just a lifestyle, but has become a necessity. Did you know, this holiday activity has a myriad of benefits, there are : 1. Reduce stress Vacationing to an exotic place can reduce the risk of blood pressure, help you sleep better, and bounce back from stress. Besides vacationing can make you happier and feel more energy. This good benefit can last you for at least more than two weeks after coming home on vacation. 2. Get out of the monotonous routine Going on vacation means you are taking a break from the routine of your daily activities. Enjoying places of interest during a holiday will recharge your energy. Vacation is like a therapy that makes a change from daily routine. This will prevent the body and mind from monotony. 3. You will be more active Going on vacation will make you more active, such as rafting, hiking, snorkling or playing beach volleyball. During your vacation you will also be required to do more things than usual. 4. Train you to adapt When you are vacationing you will meet different situations and conditions that are different from usual. That's when you'll be trained to get lulled.

Should we wait to witness the futuristic innovation that long? I don’t think so. Fransido will give you two hands open if you are up something innovative when it comes to mass  and public transportation. With total population that is in the top 5 in the world.  As the 4th populous country on earth after China, India, and United State of America, Indonesian innovators and inventors have a good capital. With the ever growing number of population spread in 34 provinces, there are a lot of ideas to come up with because every region in this country must have a transportation problem that can be solved with different approaches and solutions. One thing that we believe is that providing cheap and beneficial facilities for both parties, provider and users, is the solution  Frasindo is ready to discuss with you about your future project and help that come to life. As a business that has a core in providing assets for transportations, Frasindo believes that this kind of business will come in handy in the future. Not to mention the growth of it will bring so much benefit not only for Frasindo itself, but also for those who join and invest with us.

In the past I saw great projects but they didn't take a time (before their ICO/crowdsale) to introduce their coin/token on crypto exchanges. After ICO/crowdsale ends there were a lot of frustration because investors waited weeks before being able to trade. All that make not nice atmosphere around project, company and coin/token.  For example: currently Jelurida (the creator of Ardor) didn't spend a time with exchanges while test net was available for at least 6 months (if not longer). With beginning of 2018 Ardor started but progress with exchanges goes very slowly. All that suffocate Ardor (as well as their IGNIS, AEUR, BITSWIFT).  Are you planning to contact the biggest exchanges and do some work with them before crowdsale will end? So soon after Fras Coin will be tradable?",False

Therefor for stellar user, must be guided..   In the past we have thought carefully for few months..

But it is as a token we already have a ""GO"" sign  Here are the explanation regarding distribution & exchange= (this is also one of the reason we need to do manual distribution) 1. To balance distribution on every blockchain we really need a gateway/anchor, this job wil be handled by FRAS Child-Project in which currently under progress and being speed up.. Upcoming CoinRupiah.com (it is a stellar based anchor)  CoinRupiah will have blockchain swap feature..  In the future, DASH and LITECOIN can also be available in Stellar, same as BTC USD EUR already available as an asset in Ardor and Stellar and Ethereum  2. The distribution amount betwen blockchain will highly monitored and guarded by CoinRupiah FRAS will be released as amount of 100million on each blockchain platform..(each have 100m FRAS) However the circulation will be carefully controled to be always 100million in public..  3. With blockchain swap feature, anyone can send FRAS from stellar, become FRAS in ethereum (1in 1out)  4. When the status of FRAS has become child-chain of ARDOR similar bitswift, we will focus all our project to be housed on our own blockchain.  5. The decentralize exchange market on each blockchain can trading, the FRAS supply which is available at each blockchain, the CoinRupiah will also act as market-maker to provide liquidity in controled manner however the CoinRupiah will not control the value of the FRAS betwewn blockchain.. Supporters have possibility to arbitrage between blockchains  6. Centralize exchange market= similar to bittrex/polo/binance The community could vote wether to use which blockchain. But we will try to focus on ARDOR as a base blockchain for centralize exchange market  7. During crowdsale we do the sales through https://frasindo.com/shop platform with universal FRAS and in fixed amount to be sell Thats also more reasons to do manual distribution, no need to create allocation to be sell in 3blockchain platform.",False

The FRAS COIN it self will be distributed manually If may I suggest something. Many investors may not invest if coins/tokens that are 'distributed manually'. For example I didn't invest into Fire Lotto because I have checked their smart contracts (as well as luck of them). They will do 'manual distribution' and no one knows if that is true or a scam.  When we are speaking about Ethereum there should be no space for any 'manual actions' to eliminate possibility that - for example - issuer (in this case Frasindo) will be hacked and all coins/tokens or invested funds will be stolen. Luckily that is not a problem on Ethereum to use one of ERC20 smart contracts that will absolutely guaranteed that right number of Fras Coins will belongs to investor (to the Ethereum address from which ETHers were send).  Before crowdsale start (on Ethereum that means 'before hardcoded block number') all investors should be able to review all smart contracts (there can be one or more) that will be used for crowdfunding process and take their own decision to invest or not. ,False
