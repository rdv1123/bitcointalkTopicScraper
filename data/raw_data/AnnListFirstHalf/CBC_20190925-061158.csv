Our members earn instant rewards issued in CashBagCoin when they shop any one of our hundreds to global shopping partners. CBC can then be used within the CashBag platform for peer-to-peer transactions, to list or buy goods in our marketplace or redeemed for cash.  Origin Protocol enables both traditional marketplaces and fractional-use or sharing economy marketplaces (like short-term rentals or ride sharing) to function in a completely distributed way using Ethereum and IPFS. We are excited to be building on the Origin platform and collaborating with the talented Origin development team, which is based in San Francisco.

The app is also on Firefox and Safari. we are also working on an IE version.  Chrome is not a big OS for our users, Firefox is more popular. Our extensions are one part of our growth strategy, the other is brand awareness and changing consumers shopping patterns to start their journey through CashBag.  As for the use of funds, we’ll be investing heavily back into growing the network effect of the platform, increasing membership and driving up usage.  This requires tech, and supporting infrastructure. Our plans scale as our token sale targets do. As we increase the number of tokens sold, so we’ll be able to accelerate the speed at which we move into new markets and deploy our in-market footprint.",False

Understood about chrome, makes sense. About the app I meant actually a Google app which was downloaded less than 1000 times. AS far as I know all cashback services leveraging Androir or iOS for their applications. And 1000 downloads means your cashback service is not being in use.  Are you running the marketing campaign? I don't think your business can go far in crypto space without aggressive marketing?  I've seen the bounty campaign of yours and also I didn't understand about the pool. It is 1,2mln FIX Pool, Does it mean that you will pay 1,2mln USD even if you don't reach your goals?  Thanks",False

For us it’s less about raw downloads than it is about MAU, monthly active users, the real usage metric that matters.  Our app is only a companion for registered shoppers, currently most of whom are in the South African market.  This will change as the marketing gears up and we shift focus to aggressively pursuing more customers in other markets.  Most of our MAU activity is desktop based.  It’s shopping for travel, accommodation, office supplies, clothing etc. This is not too say that the app is not important, it is critical in our growth, but we didn’t chase app installs for its sake alone early on.
