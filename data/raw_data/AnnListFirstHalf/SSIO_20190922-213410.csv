Chats are secure. All messages encrypted using Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman X25519 algorithm client-side, then pass to SSIO nodes where they are forged and stored in the blockchain. As block time is 10 seconds, this time is needed to receive a new message. A message comes to client app encrypted also, which guarantees secure communications.    Chats are available in Wallet app now, and will be available in Dating app also.  After you login in your Wallet, open Messages tab, and click Start new chat. As Profiles are not available right now, to start a new Chat, you should know a recipient SSIO Address (like SSAD777185D5C12A38C5CD, and since there is no Profiles Search in the App yet, ask your friend for his SSIO address to test chats). Put it in Start new chat form and click Start chat. Here you go!    Here are some hints:  Chats support emoji Chats support markdown You can share links You can send images (including GIFs!), but only uploaded images are supported right now First, upload your image to any hosting, like imgur.com and get a link for this image, like https://i.imgur.com/tO8wOGv.jpg Next, paste this image link in your chat, and that’s it! To enlarge an image, click it, and it will be opened in a new browser tab  You should know any action in the blockchain costs tokens, including sending messages. Very small amount, but it costs. All this payments target to protect the system from mass attacks and support dPoS delegates.  So chats cost some small amount of SSIO tokens:  0.005 SSIO for message  For the limited time sexService.io project will compensate such expenses to make the platform easy to adopt and free. So can get your free SSIO tokens now.  What’s next?  Now we are preparing SSIO blockchain for profiles. After that, a new Dating Application with Profiles will be available. Lear more about SSIO application.  Estimate dates will be in the Roadmap (we’ll update it soon).  Look this article in SSIO blog: https://sexservice.io/introducing-sexservice-secure-chats/",False

If, we can get some view of some random people and get a chance to chat with them then that would be good.

Messages are encrypted using Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman X25519 algorithm client-side, then pass to the nodes where they are forged and stored in the blockchain. As SSIO block time is 10 seconds, it is enough time for recipient to see the message. Message comes to client app encrypted also, which guarantees secured communications.  Communities is a separate SSIO wallet, which has administrator and members (like in Telegram). More info on communities to be revealed soon.  So in the nearest future you’ll get Chats in the SSIO mainnet and application soon. Chats will be available in both Wallet (can be hidden in Settings) and Dating app, and Profiles and Communities in Dating app only due to privacy things.  Free SSIO tokens    You already know that any action in the blockchain costs tokens, very small amount, but it costs. All this payments target to protect the system from mass attacks and support dPoS delegates.  So chats, communities, and profile updates cost some small amount of SSIO tokens:  0.005 SSIO for message 0.01 SSIO for profile update 10 SSIO for creation of a community  For the limited time sexService.io project will compensate such expenses to make the platform easy to adopt and free. So can get your free SSIO tokens now. After Chats, Profiles and Communities will be available for public use, you will be able to test these features for free.  To cut off the speculations, there are terms to get free SSIO tokens. They are listed on the Get sexService token page.

Instead of trusting biased surveys or our employees, we'd like you to go out and have a discussion and get a real opinion. So for anyone living in a city in US/CA/UK/IE, we're offering to pay for a part of a dinner date (let's say about $250-300?) to meet an escort and chat about these ideas. Must be someone we both agree on, an escort with a public Twitter profile that's comfortable providing comments. Go out for dinner, chat about their work, chat about SSIO, chat about what is important, what's not important. Take notes and publish.  Write me, Brad@ thecompany.io or on Twitter (info in profile). Good or bad, it's best for everyone to hear real sex workers talk about what matters to them. We can all agree on that!  If SSIO wants to participate, we could cover the entire date together, 50/50. Let's limit it to 2 or 3 dates. You must have a public profile somewhere on social media in order to post the results.  Any takers?",False

It seems like sexService is the ICO in which even the non-investors do their investments 🙂  Just look at ICO wallet transaction list, and you’ll see a lot of purchases of SSIO amounts like from 1 to 30 tokens. All this became possible thanks to the plenty of web resources that have written about sexService development this week, so we got much visitors who do not know what a crypto is, but definitely know what a sex is… and that’s just great! Because sexService.io is for ordinary people, and investors do only take their chance to get high returns on investment.  It seems that many who took part in current ICO really found out about crypto through the sexService — when they went to localbitcoins and came back to buy SSIO. We even got few emails confirming that scenario. For sure they bought tokens not to speculate, but to use services when the platform will run alive. We need a community and strive to see when SSIO token price will be determined by users and but not by speculators.  sexService.io has developed its own system to run the ICO — a secured crypto payment processor, and now we able to exchange SSIO tokens from BTC, ETH, LTC and DOGE (more options come later). But it seems like despite all of its advantages, investors are still not very familiar with such kind of investment process.  Considering that, here is the short guide:  A little help with buying SSIO tokens  Go to the sexService ICO page. Scroll down to a payment form. Choose a crypto you want to invest, and fill the form with amount. You’ll see how much SSIO tokens you will receive right away.    If you haven’t create yourself a SSIO Wallet yet, you should Click a “Create my SSIO Wallet” link.    Save you SSIO wallet passphrase (keep in mind — this is very important step!).    Paste your passphrase from the clipboard.    Now copy your SSIO wallet address to the clipboard.    Then come back to sexService purchase form and paste your SSIO wallet address from the clipboard. Click Buy SSIO tokens button.    You’ll get a unique transfer address, which our system will check for incoming transactions. Transfer to this address the amount you filled in the form (1 BTC in this example). Once the blockchain will confirm your transaction, you’ll get SSIO tokens to your SSIO wallet automatically.  If you’ll later decide to make another SSIO purchase, please obtain a new transfer address thought the whole process (BTC/ETH/LTC/DOGE). But it is not necessary for you to create a new SSIO wallet address, so you can use the one you already have.  It is so great that sexService community is growing larger!",False

Plenty of online platforms have systems in place to prevent this, such as Eros and P411. Do your research on requirements.   Quote 2. No screening. Only a considered reputation system.  This is exactly the same as a review board, a culture many sex workers are trying to get away from. Sex workers deserve the right to know if clients are safe, clean, and honour the agreed-upon donation. A simple points or reputation system does none of this.  Quote 3. Yes, that is exactly our survey showed.    That cash is the main reason of violence among sex workers? That's an absurd statement and your survey does nothing to back up any such claim because you haven't validated your survey with any research methods. You're just using it to promote the idea that tokens should be used instead of cash, but this in reality is a huge hassle and is likely going to drive people awat from your platform.  Quote  4. Yes, noone can provide guaranties. Even if case of centralized system and document ID checking.   I'm a sex worker and I would never use a site that has zero guarantees.

If you have started an interesting project, investors won’t be the only one to be around. Today we’ll tell you about spam, frauds, threats, attempts to hack, and even ransom requests.  Threats and ransom requests You got to know, that collaboration and service offers are not the only way people use to get money from ICO teams. There is a place for threats also 😉  Here is the email we got a few days earlier:    If they send such emails, it is obvious that some teams accept to pay their ransom. Our position  is like “never negotiate with terrorists”. First, if we’ll pay, it will support these bastards and encourage them to continue with other teams. Second — there’s no guaranties that others won’t make similar threats to us. So what is the reason to pay such pack of jackals?  And our answer was this simple:    Yes, then two DDoS waves had covered our website, but we resolved the problem quickly enough. While our tech had been making improvements, the hosting provider scrubbed all the evil traffic. Actually it is quite costly to handle a DDoS attack for days period. So, if your time costs less than 2 BTC, just fuck these faggots.  Remember the golden rule: be sure to make automatic backups and check manually if everything goes well.  Attempts to hack Everybody loves money, and if there is a way to get them fast, and even not the honest way, be sure — someone will try to do it. So every single day our website is a target to hackers.  Hopefully, even if our security if not perfect, we are working on it constantly.  For now, all of hacking attempts were fought off. We will not give any details because of security reasons. But think about the IT security in the very beginning of your project… even if there are some kind of “who will need this?” thoughts in mind.  Frauds After you start your ICO, you will be contacted by rogues.    Obviously that is a fraud email, but there were more serious tries. So be sure not to pay for any services before you are absolutely confident about their authenticity.  Spam in in your mailbox That is really funny to get absolutely irrelevant messages. That one was the most funny.    Translate using Google: “Drug from parasites Baktefort, available currency and password about treatment”. Now we sure know what to do in case of parasites appear.. Hmmm.. We can use Baktefort when we’ll receive the next DDoS threat!  Well, we are sure it is not the full list of challenges for ICO teams. Stay tuned.",False

Having SSIO tokens, you become a stakeholder sexService is a distributed system with no central authority where SSIO holders rules.  The sexService blockchain uses DPOS algorithm. Total amount of SSIO tokens is limited — there are 50,000,000 SSIO at the beginning, which slowly (for decades) grows to the maximum of 150,000,000 SSIO (these newly created tokens intend to cover the expenses for those, who running nodes to maintain all the infrastructure).  So every SSIO token holder is also a sexService stakeholder.  Buying sex related services and goods Sex is a 186 Billion dollars market, and we are going play a part in it. SSIO tokens will be a payment unit to buy services, provided by sexService members. We’re planning to attract sex related industry also, like sex shops, so you will be able to buy stuff.  As in any distributed system, every transaction should be covered by fee. SSIO tokens will be used as a payment intermediary for creation of a community for example.  Speculations Speculations are a common fact for crypto World. ICOs are attracting investors, because token prices are intend to grow (sometimes even tenfolds) after the end of the each one ICO. So this is a way to make money (like a startup), offering very high return rates on investments.  Nowadays token prices in general rise after particular token lists on exchanges, and that leads to a rise of speculation interests. But SSIO token price will strive to growth not because of speculations, but due to an added value. When the sexService will have enough users with their everyday needs, the necessity in SSIO as a payment unit will lead to huge growth of its price.

In order to understand which direction to move further, two month ago we started a small survey campaign. We decided to questionnaire girls, involved in sex industry, and girls, who are not.  The main purpose was to understand if they are familiar with internet dating and cryptocurrency. Before the girls answered the questions, they were asked to have a look at sexService.io website and were given some tech explanations. Microsoft Excel was used to interpret and visualize the responses. Today we’re going to share the results with you.  Girls involved in sex industry With the kind help of our partners, who wished to remain anonymous (from three non English speaker countries, where sex services are not legal), more than 80 women involved in sex industry took part in our small survey.          Girls not involved in sex industry We randomly contacted women via social networks, and asked if they agree to participate in the survey anonymously. So we got us about a hundred of women who took part in the survey. Here are the calculated results.          Commentaries Thanks to everyone who took part in our survey and to our partners!  Now you can make your own conclusions about the survey results. And as for sexService, it seems that the platform can be interesting for both categories of women.  Later we will try to make a public survey where any woman can take her part… and for now there are still some issues with this. If we will pay for participating, anyone could overuse it, and it is difficult to understand if a respondent appears to be a real woman (and not a man). If we would not, there will be almost no motivation to take part in. Maybe it should be done via a survey integrated right in a blockchain.  Women pre-registrations Actually even before the future App launch more than 200 women have joined our pre-registration bounty campaign. It is a drop in the ocean, but we are sure it is a good sign.  All the registered girls are generally aged 21-33, and some do provide sex services, but there are many of them which are just looking for a partner or joining for other reasons. Locations are different all over the World, but Russia’s percent slightly stands out.  Mostly they didn’t provide photos, but some of them left image links and agreed to be published.

I am not trying to be arrogant, but simply combining JavaScript and blockchain will not make a good-to-use service for the sex industry. As far as SSIO, first, the name is gonna turn off a majority of your serious workers. Second, requiring even Bitcoin makes it DOA, but requiring a specific token is far worse. I'd love to be wrong and that random digital currencies were trivial for people to use. But that reality is far off, if it ever happens. So for years, it's a non-starter.  Decentralized has serious reputation problems. If a client is abusive, with a decentralized system they can just be a new user. Who will verify their identity? This is a real problem sex workers face. Clients put their reputation and marriages at risk. Providers put their livelihood and lives at risk. It's very asymmetrical. Decentralized also means no customer support. Look at Amazon for example. If you order something from them and it doesn't work or isn't right, they're happy to give you a refund. Internally, they make a risk assessment and if you abuse it, they'll cut you off. But they can afford to lose a bit of money in the short term, because they are focused on the client's lifetime value. Decentralized systems cannot see this, and if they do, they make themselves open for exploitation.  At best, decentralized can provide a Backpage 2.0, complete with scams, fake pictures, law enforcement. And we already have Backpage and sites like it, so making it decentralized doesn't really accomplish much.  Question: Does SSIO have sex workers on their product team?",False

Today we are posting not for our users mainly, but for teams who are thinking about their own ICO.  Running your ICO? Check out these hints.  Yeah, it is the first ICO for our team. That is because we were thinking about the product from the start and not about the money. As time have passed, we did realize we can’t cover expenses anymore, and have decided to run an ICO.  To be honest, we were surprised about the ICO hype at the moment, but now we’ll speak from ICO team point of view, especially about marketing — because there is only a few useful information on the Internet about this topic.  So, you have a project and decide to run an ICO. How to tell your target auditory about it?  Target auditory Actually it is a simple question. You need people who have some crypto already.  Even if sexService is the project for everyone, and we do all the best to populate the idea among sexually active people, and explain the blockchain and crypto related matters, none of them actually will buy bitcoin and invest. That is because there is too much misunderstanding. These users will come only after the product spread to masses. So in our case advertising on sex related (porn, sex dating, etc.) websites is pretty useless in terms of getting investors.  Another option — your local investors, and there are many possibilities if you can speak to them directly. They should be the first to know about your project — and if they would not give money for it, then you should think if your project is really interesting.  Everyday offers in your mailbox Right after announce we have been receiving up to 20 emails with offers every usual day. They are quite similar though — publications, listings, social networks, and advertising networks. All of them ask for money.  Crazy things happen around ICOs now. Everybody think if your are running an ICO, you have unlimited money, and want to suck on you. Honest to be, offers with 1 BTC price are rare, most are from 2+ BTC.    So keep calm.  ICO sites There are plenty of ICO-related sites. At first sight these sites are the only thing you need to succeed, but that is wrong.  We have sent requests to list our ICO to these sites:  icocountdown.com 52ico.com icoinfo.net icorating.com icochecker.com/contact tokenmarket.net smithandcrown.com cyber.fund/radar icotracker.net icocoins.com tokeninvestor.com yunbi.com icoage.com allcoin.com coinschedule.com icorating.info icobench.com/publish cointelegraph.com/ico-calendar ico-list.com coingecko.com/ico?locale=en coinstaker.com happycoin.club icocrowd.com/calendar icobazaar.com/list cryptocompare.com/ico/ icotimeline.com cryptocoincharts.info/ico icowatchlist.com topicolist.com applancer.co/ico-list icocalendar.today coinmarket.news/kalendar-ico icostats.com tokentops.com foundico.com icodaily.net icotoday.io picoloresearch.com crushcrypto.com verifiedicos.com icodrops.com tokendata.io coinfunda.com Not all of them have listed sexService.io. Some refused because we are sex-related, some just ignored our request, and with some we did refuse to pay the service fees.  And the most interesting is money, which ICO sites ask, are not reasonable (they ask about 0.5 BTC for listing in general, up to 6 BTC!). Our paid listings compared to free ones gave us less visitors. (Hint: make an ico-some-shit.com website now, and contact ICO teams with your offer — you’ll make money even if you have zero visitors). So there is no connection between visitors you get and price you pay.  Prices are crazy.    Among all of this list we can highlight icoalert.com (free listing), icotracker.net (free listing), which really bring target auditory. And icorating.info… there was no meaningful traffic from it, but the guys put a unique approach to listing, not just showing info you filled on the form as others did, but attached some creativity and labour.  Special attention deserves ICO rating systems. Rare who will go deep in your project, and establish project rating upon a research. Most have automatic “check” system. Have a Twitter link? Check. Have team members LinkedIn links? Check. Ethereum smart contract? Check. All of them like “Whitepapers”. We don’t know if they actually read them, but we had seen so many projects with Shitpapers (better word) describing abstract World dominance for investors, as well as obviously scam projects, where good ratings received. They are so far from Bitcoin tech-based Whitepaper.  Nobody cares that sexService have reasons to have an anonymous team, nobody cares the Website provides comprehensive information about the project — Whitepaper needed. Nobody cares we are not 1-minute-Ethereum token, and already built a conception, a blockchain, wallet app, unique ICO and referral systems. Nobody cares we are deep in development — we had no social campaigns. So sexService has a bad rating.  Advertising networks We tried some advertising networks and spent about 1 BTC total, and they gave zero returns. Zero.  So we tried to analyse visitors coming from these networks. It seems they are just bots. Because we can’t prove it, we won’t name any of them.  Later we learned there are websites, who gives similar traffic, like trafers.com:    You put a link to a website, and new tab in your browser opens other websites, who participate similarly. Google Analytics shows visitors really comes from Trafers. Think about the quality of such a traffic.  Editorial The best phrase that reflects the essence is “When you are in need of the press, no one will write about you, and when they will write about you, you will no longer need it”.  All feedbacks we received were the offers for paid articles.  Forums Despite of there are many crypto related forums, the only one you should pay attention is Bitcointalk.org. This forum have Altcoins Announcement thread, and Altcoin Bounty threads, where you better add your token.  Not a huge flow goes from the Bitcointalk, but most of them are quite familiar with crypto theme, and some are even looking for projects to invest in.  Bitcointalk has many threads in the category, and you need to make active discussion in yours in order it appears on the first page. Some teams buy stolen BTT accounts for this reason and make useless posts every minute.  Other forums we used to announce a project:  allcryptotalk.com bitcoinforum.com forum.bitcoin.com cryptocurrencytalk.com But there were few views, and we decided to stop their support and had redirected users to our Bitcointalk thread.  Social networks We have started social accounts not long ago, but many users have joined already. The most visited are Twitter and Facebook, the less one is Google+.  A very mixed auditory comes from the social networks. But the good thing is that your followers pool is always growing.  The main rule you should remember is if you start social campaign, don’t interrupt it.  Contributors Once you’ve announced your project, there will be people who will be interested in it. In case of sexService, the number of contributors is high and it’s growing.  Contributors help the project with translations, making posts, social media campaigns, forums support, etc. The best place for searching contributors is Bitcointalk, there are many users who are ready to join, if you’ll interest them. All of them worked for SSIO tokens.  To hold a contribution campaign, you should state what kinds of contribution accepted, estimate each kind in your tokens, and provide a form (e. g., Google online form), where a contributor can register.  sexService greatly excels in the way users receive their contribution rewards, brought Bounty cards, integrated in the blockchain. Once user get a Bounty code, he may enter it in the Wallet app, and the blockchain transfers tokens to the user’s wallet.    sexService got hundred of contributors in a month. Later we have introduced a referral campaign, which have replaced usual contribution campaign where a link to a website can be placed (contributions for translations are still open).  Referrals is an objective way of evaluation of contributes, offering real income (5% of investors’ payments + 5% SSIO), and this kind of objectiveness actually reduces contributors number, but increases contributions quality. E. g., if someone have 20,000 twitter followers, and knows they are bots, will join regular contributors campaign, but abandon referral one. (By the way, it refers also for blogs, sites like ico-something.com, and so on).    Referrals became significant way in gathering investments, and now more and more investors come via referrals. This is because there is no limit for storing cookies, and someone who visited sexservice.io website can make an investment in a week or month later. And we have about 10 new joined referrals every day.  Resume Understand the reasons you run the ICO. If you are doing it to get maximum amount of money, create an Ethereum-based token in minutes, create your social networks accounts, post links to your team members and advisors (better with known names), and write (or plagiarize) a Whitepaper. Run a massive marketing campaign. You’ll get good ratings and attract plenty of investors. No project needed.  We have 90% development, and 10% marketing budget. Later we spoke to people who are experienced in ICOs, and they say you should have 95% marketing budget.  To run really successful ICO (totally without viable idea or product) be ready to spend from $100,000 for marketing.  And if you decide doing things without such a budget, concentrate on a product. We got the necessary investments to continue sexService development, but it seems like most of investors did choose to buy at a price of $5 instead of today’s $1.7 — when some famous medias will be spoken about us already.",False

That’s why we are working on sexService.  There are most common of sex market problems:  Trafficking and forcing to sex Violence against women, lack of protection Frauds and robberies Legality status Difficulties in finding a perfect match and particular services for a client Lack of channels to advertise for sex companies and workers STIs  The mentioned problems are the most common for sex industry.  sexService Advantages Developed countries are trying to solve some of them by legalising prostitution, and offering social guaranties to the sex workers. In most other countries prostitution is legally prohibited, but there is no strict prosecution, understanding this is unstoppable and in general not harmful kind of services. And in some countries sex services are strictly prohibited.  sexService strive to resolve some of sex market problems, focusing on countries where prostitution has legal or around-legal status.  SSIO as a platform, based on a blockchain with application2 as user interface, will organize relationship between clients and service providers, targeting in general to reduce all of these problems less or more. So they can be divided in two groups:  Strong SSIO impact    Violence against women, lack of protection Frauds and robberies Difficulties in finding a perfect match and particular services for a client Lack of channels to advertise for sex companies and workers  Weak SSIO impact Trafficking and forcing to sex Legality status STIs   Problems with weak SSIO impact more depends on involvement of governments.  The most obvious for place of the sexService platform is providing an interface to clients and sex workers to find and connect each other, avoiding time loss and third parties. So sex workers and sex companies will receive a great way to present their services to potential clients through Communities and Broadcasting, and involving new kind of auditory. Clients will get a perfect tool to find the particular service and appropriate worker.  Indirectly sexService also will reduce violence against women, frauds and robberies eliminating cash as a payment system3. Though we understand it will take time, and anyone can use sexService to establish a contact, and to pay cash at a meet-up, but we are sure later (it may take years4) tokens will press out cash as a payment option.  See all the benefits, which sexService offers for all the involved in sex industry parties, including cathouses or pimps, sex related companies, sex workers, and sex clients.  Monetization and Digits sexService will be profitable for its investors.  In case of slow market penetration, sexService platform can take 1% of sex market value in the first year of operation, which is about $2 Billion. This volume will go through sexSerice in SSIO tokens, and used for:  Payments for main services Payments for goods and services of third party companies Creating and supporting Communities Broadcasting and advertising services Transaction fees for Profiles, Images and Chats Reputation system support  To realize the monetization conception, there are many options for sexService which will help to attract both clients and service providers:  sexService.io has a big enough stock in its Bounty Wallet to help with resolving possible disputes, so every user or business is potentially able to receive an adequate compensation in case of a problem occurs. For the first years sexService.io team will compensate SSIO fees to make sexService easy to adopt and free. Easy to join and easy to use. No emails or other IDs required. Decentralisation, Blockchain-proven Reputation System & Feedbacks. Application is simple to use, works on any mobile phone, and needs absolutely no installation. Safe and Secure: Two-step digital transactions dramatically Reduce Risks of Frauds and Violence against users. New auditory and possibilities for sex companies and sex workers Bounties for women for joining the sexService Many other small, but important benefits  Actually we have a strong plan how to get into the sex industry, and later we’ll tell more.  In five years sexService is able to get 10% or more of sex industry, or about 20 Billion in USD. Statistics shows that average payment for sex service in developed country starts from $50. Based on these digits, total capitalization of SSIO token should be at least $500 Millions, or 50,000,000 tokens by $10 each.  This was a reason to choose such a SSIO token specification.  Note that sex related services like webcam shows and selling images, sex dating by mutual sympathy5, and other are not accounted and should be added.    --- 1.

We kindly ask to translate this post in yuor local BTT thread.  What we are working on exactly  We had already told about how many advantages a blockchain offers for sex services industry, and today we are going to tell you what to expect from sexService exactly.  sexService.io is a platform which includes a blockchain-based infrastructure, a user application to interact with it, and SSIO tokens as a payment system. Since users interact with the platform via the application, let’s talk about the conception from this particular point of view.  There will be several types of sexService.io users in general:  * A cathouse, business or individual, who patronage sex workers * A sex worker, who provides services individually, or under someone’s management * A webcam or cosplay girl, provides remote services * A person or group, which has some sex demands. Man or woman, straight or gay, etc. Looking for some paid offers or just a casual sex dating. * A sex-related company or individual with an interest to enhance his (her) business —  offering something and doing advertising. * And all these types of users listed above will be connected in a new way of communication. To make it real, the sexService app is going to run the following features.    A user owns a profile, which contains all the information, like his age (18+), location, appearance, images, offers and demands. So anyone can have both offers and demands, which are classified by type, and are priced or free. Images can be public or hidden. Profile tuning is an important thing, but we will not go deep in now, though actually have a structure already.  A user can be an individual, group, or business.  Sex workers has a choice to provide services individually, and get all the income, or to join a cathouse / get protected by a pimp. Despite of all blockchain advantages, the interviews showed that it is more confident for most women to work under the patronage. But webcam girls and cosplayers are better to work individually to get all the profit.  To start working with a cathouse or a pimp, a sex worker will receive a request to join with conditions described, e.g. 35% income goes to a cathouse.  Generally using sexService app is similar to other dating services — you create a profile, and then search for offers or wait responses for your demands. Also there are some important differences.  First there’s no need for any emails, phone numbers, contacts or payment info to create a profile. Second, all offers and demands in sexService are precise and important.  And the most notable is that any action costs tokens, very small amount, but it costs. It is a blockchain-specific thing, because all the expenses on the network activity must be covered as well — all this payments are to protect the system from mass attacks.  So chats, communities, and profile updates should cost some small amount of SSIO tokens. For the first years sexService.io team will compensate such expenses to make sexService easy to adopt and free.  The way users communicate with each other is to be a bit different too. For example — if a man finds a girl which he’s interested in, to chat with her, he has to buy one of her services. And she does not receive his payment instantly, cause his tokens are kept in temporary wallet. If they’ll meet then — the transactions could be finished. This scheme of communication is made primary for sex workers, so they would not waste time on useless chats. But any user can allow free contacts, as well as agree to receive local broadcasts.  Every user in sexService has a reputation. We won’t say much about it for now, as it is a complicated internal system to provide a reliable member score. This reputation system is implemented to help people with finding each other & making right choices.  Every woman who joins the community will receive a welcome reward bounty when her reputation will rise from the ground. So this is another good reason to give our service a try.  The sexService.io app will include different real-life services (like sex, massage, etc.), as well as remote ones — webcam shows or selling erotic photos.  The main common problem for women  with most remote sex services is a very high commission rates (up to 70%) they need to pay to a platform provider (a website). SSIO app will allow them to eliminate intermediaries with no risk. As for webcam shows, they will be out of blockchain (cause there is no possibility to store videos in the blockchain for now), and sexService app will be used to interconnect clients with girls. But selling photos can be realized with a smart contracts approach.  Anyone can create a community. It is like a community in social network, but the main purpose is in making a thematic association. For example: “Broadway Cathouse”, “LGBT community”, “The Noisy Sexshop”. In this way a community holder could have an auditory to spread his news and offers with.  Communities are an essential part of sexService app. They will be maintained by local businesses — cathouses or sex shops, for example, or just enthusiasts. We’re expecting many kinds of thematic communities like Gay, Lesbian, Trans, and more… because they are usually oppressed in real life. Local companies, like bars and clubs, can use broadcasting to notify people around about the upcoming events.  The platform should enhance possibilities for businesses. Cathouses will get a new channel for clients attraction, introducing new services, and ability to generate sex welcome cards for some types of clients. Well, they’ll get a possibility to engage new sex workers also.  sexService Application will use the internal payment system in SSIO token to eliminate cash-involved problems. If still preferred, anyone can use sexService to find a perfect match, and to pay cash at a meet-up, but we are sure later (it may take years) tokens will press out cash as a payment option. So to become a sexService stakeholder and to use its services, you should buy some SSIO tokens. The best option is join the ICO now, because you will buy tokens cheaper, than your neighbour will:    Buy sexService tokens in the ICO.  sexService.io has a big enough stock in it’s Bounty Wallet to help with resolving possible disputes, so every user or business is potentially able to receive an adequate compensation in case of a problem occurs.  Everyday we’re doing our best to involve more people to the sexService community all over the World.    To set off the feature list, it will include:  * Profiles * Location * Chat * Communities * Images * Connecting sex workers to cathouses * Offers and demands search * Two-step communications (and payments) * Local broadcasting * Reputation system * Remote services (webcam, cosplay)  Well, this is a today’s vision of sexService Application. Some features will be changed and some will be added. It depends on our future researches in sex industry, opinions of sex-involved people, and your opinion also — tell us what you think.  This article can be found on our website via link https://sexservice.io/what-we-are-working-on-exactly/. These vision updates are also reflected in our Roadmap.",False

Why tokens are a way better than cash  For most people it seems like there’s nothing better than an old-good hard cash for paying for sex services. Right? – Not really, cause all’s not quite that simple as it appears to be.  To answer this question, we’ve done a small research and spoke to a few people which are partly involved in sex industry. Their stories helped us to understand why cash is not so good actually. You see, there are much problems related to hard cash payments. And the main three are: violence against women (robberies), frauds, and legality status of such payments.  The first and the most bad thing about hard cash is that it appears to be a very major reason for violence offences. Most sex workers (as also their clients) says that they were harmed due to a robbery at least once. So this is the first thing about tokens and why they are so great... because they are digital assets. And in that case — they can’t be taken forcibly in a rapid robbery manner. You are not longer required to take any money for a meet-up!  The second cash-involved problem is frauds and thefts. The primary possibility for this kind of offences lies in the nature of hard cash and a casual deal scheme, where goods or services are traded in exchange for money from one person to another. And due to a slippery moral ethics related to prostitution, combined with it’s illegal status in most communities, of course there is no any adequate law that could protect such deals and the ones who trade sex services for money. Therefore — frauds become a rather usual thing among sex workers and their clients. All this could be easily eliminated with the right use of digital tokens as a trading assets. Thanks to great technologies implemented in these assets, a two-step (escrow kind of) deal could be executed between parties to help their exchange become more transparent, reliable and safe. So there is no better fraud-protection at this case than using tokens.  And finally, the legal aspect… At present only a few government jurisdictions do really allow “sex for money” trading. So mostly, it is a very common situation for a sex worker to be arrested by police right after they’re given cash money from their client or an undercover cops. But if there is no money involved in such a deal — there is no actual law violation and therefore it couldn’t be regarded as prostitution.  So we pose sexService.io as a sex dating service with mutual sympathy and sex-related communications, which are allowed by most countries’ jurisdictions. SSIO may include paid intimacy services, but there will be no payments in real money. Instead we use tokens which are considered as goods in most countries, and therefore could be treated like a present or a gift.  In such a scheme a user actually just encourages other party for starting a casual communication (by making a first step in a transaction — reserving tokens), and there is no actual payment involved... there’s only a chance of committing for that transaction in the course of overall communication. And let’s get it clear — actually, it’s nobody’s business that two grown up persons were so happy to meet each other that they made any kind of intimacy together (even if they really had sex the same day).  We do understand that people need to get used to tokens and this is the inevitable future.  The most essential part for now is — an easy, convenient and fast tokens to cash conversion. So we’re working hard to implement it for our users right in the SSIO Wallet application. Got tokens? – You’re just two clicks away to get cash for them! And as there are already so many services helping to convert hundreds of different tokens to USDT or Bitcoins online… it seems absolutely clear that someday it will be as easy and fast as using an ordinary ATM.  Meanwhile anyone can use sexService to find a perfect match, and to pay cash (or even gold maybe) at a meet-up. If still preferred.",False

We are the fuel for the Bitcoin  Many people visiting our website are looking for dating and not technologies. They do not have a Bitcointalk account and know nothing about cryptocurrencies! And that is just wonderful! Because sexService.io is not for geeks, but for real people.  Though there are yet some obstacles for understanding the difference from usual dating services because this service is based on unfamiliar approach. Blockchain… Bitcoin… ICOs…  Some people say Bitcoin helps us to rise the project, but we believe that actually such services are helping Bitcoin to spread among people. It is because only few need Bitcoin, but everybody need sex and dating. That way people learn about sexService first, and then face that it is based on Bitcoin’s technologies. Though we do understand that is not quick and easy process. It just takes time. People are conservative in their nature, and skeptic to all new, especial to technologies. Remember how it was hard to accept Bitcoin — it was rejected not only by personals, but by governments! Remember how folks believed online dating is useless! But good thing that changes are unavoidable.  From day to day people will realize how many advantages the blockchain brings in to dating services. If not sexService will make a move, others will. sexService is a true gamechanger. We solve such problems like lack of anonymity and data security, frauds, low trust to a partner, and cash-involved issues.

Blockchain is pretty new technology which brings highest level of storing and managing information as secured and reliable as it should be. Bitcoin was the first and main implementation of blockchain that was designed as a payment instrument. Then people realized a blockchain is not only about payments, but it covers many parts of human life.  ICO (or initial coin offering), is like selling shares of a company, but those shares named as coins or tokens. Those, who buy tokens, become stakeholders, and can take part in company’s being, and share its profits. Any company in this world has no owner, it is decentralized, even developers are just the workers. The stakeholders, which are many, are the owners. ICO helps developers to get money for making a product, like Kickstarter or Patreon do.  To join the sexService community, take this steps: Get familiar with Bitcoin and buy some Create a new sexService wallet Transfer some Bitcoins to sexService and get sexService tokens in return  Now we hope that this scenario above will help you to understand what sexService.io is. We strive to deliver new level of dating based on blockchain technology and offer you to join the sexService ICOs. To learn more about sexService.io and get reasons to participate, go and read on our FAQ page.",False

Initial SSIO tokens distribution (ICO) and funds usage According to SexService token specification, genesis block is of 50 000 000 SSIO. Because of SexService is a social project, the major part of SSIO tokens should be distributed among users, 85% total: 55% for sale and 30% for bounties.  55% is for pre-ICO & ICO crowdsale (27 500 000 SSIO) 20% is for women bounties (10 000 000 SSIO) lifetime 10% is for contributors bounties (5 000 000 SSIO) 5% is for development team (2 500 000 SSIO) 10% is a system reserve (5 000 000 SSIO)  We want this whole distribution to be transparent. So see the details below.  SexService (SSIO Token) ICO The SexService ICO intends to become an easy way for everyone to acquire SSIO tokens and the most convenient way for users who want to join the community. All cryptos received during ICO will support future development, marketing and advertisement of SexService and it’s blockchain services in future.  First ICO is planned for 30 of August 2017 for a time period of 40 days. Second ICO is planned for December 2017 for a time period of 25 days. Third ICO is planned for March 2018 for a time period of 25 days.  Why there will be three ICO? All parties would see the development progress and the token value growth, so those who join ICO earlier, could get more tokens by cheaper price. That will support project team and encourage earlier contributions. And for the present moment (before First ICO starts) all participants can reserve SSIO tokens twice cheaper, than on First ICO ($0.85). The precise Pre-ICO token amount gain for such contributors will be calculated dynamically based on the crypto they’ll transfer on the date of their transaction. We accept BTC, ETH and BCC (BCH) currencies.  SSIO token prices for the future ICOs: Pre-ICO: $0.85 per token, starting from now ICO-1: $1.7 per token, August-September ICO-2: $5.3 per token, December ICO-3: $10 per token, March of 2018  So take part in SexService token distribution before the price growth.  Women bounties To make women’s interest higher, we offer bounties for creating a profile. Those girls, who create profile before ICO-1, receive 20 tokens ($200 at time of ICO-3), and 10 tokens for those who do it later, reducing by 0.1 token each month, till it reach minimum of 1 token. When wallet address creates, it has no profile. Once profile is created, gender should be chosen, and it cannot be changed later. To eliminate cheating, profiles will receive bounty tokens only after its reputation raise. Such a system will encourage women to join SexService community and offer services. An amount of 10 000 000 SSIO (20%) are allocated for women bounties.  Bounties for contributors To make SexService community larger, we will encourage any social efforts with bounties. The budget for such form of contribution is 5 000 000 SSIO (10%). Tell about us on your blog, website, forums, social networks and more. Remember that this is a social project, and the more people will know about it — the more comfortable you’ll use it.  System reserve 10% of tokens (5 000 000 SSIO) will be deposited in reserve wallet. Though it is a rather small amount, it can help to provide system updates and to respond user demands promptly. Other side, small amount of reserve wallet tokens intends blockchain to be decentralized. These token can support future project development and encourage contributions also.  Coin markets Once ICO-3 finished, all of future token exchange will be provided by coin markets. Anybody who wants to take part and use community services, can buy SSIO tokens easily.",False

This service is for people.  We pose SexService as sex dating service by mutual sympathy and sex-related communications.  Many wants new relations but are holding with some obstacles. There are main of three: anonymity, safety, and a fear of rejection. It must be not obvious, but a blockchain makes the new level of dating.  Nobody can bind a wallet/profile with a particular person. There are no emails or bank card or other identification information (which have a login/password or PIN) in the profile, so you can always say “that was created not by me”. The main profile photo can be not yours, and your real photos can be accessed only by those who you allowed. The system is decentralized and secure (based on a cryptography), so you won’t get issues like Ashley Madison. Nobody has access to your profile information, even developers.  Some people are worried about to have a sex service application icon on the device. While mobile phone application can be installed on the device, it is not necessary, SSIO provides a web application accessed via a mobile phone or desktop browser, where all the history can be cleared after (or just use a Private Tab).  When you make a payment, there are no need to input your personal information, you just pay from your wallet in SSIO coins directly.  Your choice of person to contact should be based upon profile information and blockchain-proofed reputation. Blockchain transactions cannot be removed or changed. All of the profile history tends to help you make a choice. Do you want more security? Meet person which have a strong reputation and long profile life.  Next, if you are dating for money, you’ll get it. Nobody can block a payment, or take the payment back. Actually you get money at the start of communication, committing the transaction when you meet other party. We recommend women commit a transaction before the service provided as a weaker side.  Fear of rejection decreases while you understand everybody have the same purpose at the service. It is much more convenient than to approach a woman at the street and say “I just wanna sex.”.  Both men and women have their needs, and they differs. So SSIO offers the scenario you are searching for.  Men are often looking for satisfaction, confession, significance. Some use paid sex workers, some need a mutual sympathy. Some are single, and some just want to look aside family troubles rarely. SexService.io tends to be a choice: there are so much different goals of dating, and everybody will find the fit.  Women want to be desirable for the particular type of men. They can be looking for well-off men, or just a handsome guy.  For those girls, who want get money for dating, SexService.io is the best place. Every man is solvent, no more time loss with useless chats. That is because he must pay (reserve money) even before he starts a communication. You choose how much he should pay. No intermediaries and pimps, you don’t need them. Women receive all the money. SexService is where you can make money not only on dating, but also webcam show, selling photos, etc.  Some women are like men in sexual questions, they are independent, and all that they need is a reliable sex partner for even rare meetups. We want they also fit their interests in the SexService.  There will be many of possible scenarios using SexService. Do you want to hold a party? Attracting people to a new club? Or just looking for a person for a company to take a trip? Yeah, SSIO is the right choice.  But we understand SSIO is not only for individuals, and want our service to offer advantages also for sex and escort providing companies.  Sure SSIO is the best platform for sex workers, but it not just about sex workers. Life is changing, life can be better. This service is for people.  Join us now..",False
