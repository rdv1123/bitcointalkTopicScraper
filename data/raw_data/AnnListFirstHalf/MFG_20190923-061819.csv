In due time I couldn't come to Vechain on the platform existing then https://ico.info Their share was bought out within 3-5 minutes, and I already knew that there were whales from PWC. As for syncFab, I think it is a wonderful project and it will be in demand in such a growing market. The only thing - I would like to see such promising projects on faster and more scalable chains, with side gateways, sidechains. Such things expand the field for maneuvers in the future. The Ethereum is not the best choice in this regard. It will take too long for Vitalik and his team to improve the scalability of the network (let's say Raiden Network add - in to migrate transactions to non-core blocks, as an example) as Mobius, using the Stellar blockchain.Or for example scry.info - add-on over ether, but still they will build their blockchain, different from ether.
