This is largely due to the automation of many business processes of financial institutions at different stages of lending.  Evaluation of the borrower  The main task of a microfinance organization is to quickly make the right decision whether or not to lend to a particular borrower. In fact, this is the main expertise of the company, on which depends the success of the entire business. Already many companies use special computer programs for this task. They are called scoring systems or decision-making systems. The potential borrower is automatically assessed according to a large number of parameters, resulting in an assessment of all risks and ready decision. Such software gathers information about the borrower from a variety of sources such as credit bureaus, payment systems, location services, etc.  Large players develop software on their own, but for many this is done through outsourcing, that is, it is more profitable for a financial organization to buy software from a supplier than to develop it yourself from scratch. Major players in the market (about 90%) are companies FICO and SAS.  The evaluation of the collateral  In the case of secured lending, in addition to assessing the potential borrower, it is necessary to assess the collateral. Today’s financial startups automate this task as well. For example, the platform SHIFT.cash deals with loans secured by car titles. The creators of the project have developed an automated system for evaluating cars by using a special algorithm. Thanks to the built-in big data analysis module (Big Data), the system instantly analyzes all market information of a particular region, on the basis of which it provides an estimate for liquidity and value of the vehicle. The automation of assessment of collateral, as well as a number of other processes, allowed to turn the entire project online. Thanks to the developed algorithm, it became possible to scale to the markets of other countries. At this stage, the program is tested in several European countries, but is going to enter the international arena.  CRM-system  One of the main drivers of credit market development is the creation of companies whose work is fully online. That is, the borrower has the opportunity to fill in an application for a loan online without leaving his/her home, and then automatically when approved to receive borrowed funds to your card.  This was made possible by the introduction powerful CRM-systems by powerful financial companies in which the workflow is carefully thought through. In particular, basic software allows for downloading data from the Bureau of credit histories, sms-informing of borrowers of due and past due payments, etc., creating settings for each loan product, drawing up contracts, etc., many processes are done automatically, so there is no need for an office and a large number of employees.  The interaction of the parties  Another important process in the field of credit, which was also subjected to automation, is the interaction of different market participants with each other.  For example, the first step of the whole process is to attract traffic of potential customers. Often, this function is outsourced by financial institutions to companies specializing in lead generation, that is, collecting loan applications through numerous channels. The result is something like an online storage of loan applications, from where companies already buy these applications and process them.  P2P lending is based entirely on process automation. This type of lending involves the direct interaction of individuals (borrower and lender) through an automated online platform. Through it, the parties agree on the terms of the loan and carry out the transaction, and the site receives a Commission for it. By the way, this niche has already been populated by platforms that work with cryptocurrencies, which means that it is possible to do transactions from one point in the world to any other. Among them is the platform btcjam.com, www.bitbond.com and others.  In addition, there are services that simplify the process in terms of interaction between investors and financial institutions. One of them is the Blackmoon platform. It connects financial institutions with potential investors. Information about verified loan applications from the company is available to Blackmoon. The platform analyzes the profitability when investing in loan portfolios by a variety of parameters and determines whether it fits the investor’s stated conditions. The platform itself takes a percentage of the invested funds and net profit of the investor. The platform works with large investors: ready to invest from $ 500 thousand.  “Automation of business processes is extremely important for financial institutions. Firstly, the speed and convenience of the service, in fact, is the essence of such companies. Secondly, although automation is expensive at the stage of implementation, in the medium term it pays for itself due to savings in the rental of premises, the work of employees, intermediaries and so on,” says Thomas Novak, the Creator of the SHIFT.cash platform.",False

Firstly, whats the purpose of this bonus token, other than promo? Adding functionless promo tokens to my wallet address is like the crypto version of sending me junk mail - it does the project no favours in my eyes and I just find it rather annoying.  If you're going to airdrop for promo, at least send the ACTUAL platform token. Sheesh..   That aside, I did check out the website and whitepaper.  Interesting project but doesn't really get me excited from an investment point of view. The ICO token price is a little too high for my liking.  Also, risking your car title for only 35% of its value? Not a huge enticement from a user perspective, in my opinion. As I'm in Australia, I guess its not relevant to me anyway, as the project doesn't operate in my country.

It can be information of any kind, including monetary transactions, which make the blockchain system such an important technology for the financial industry. For example, our platform SHIFT.cash, specializes in loans secured by car titles, uses blockchain. This means that the money of investors who make loans and their personal information will be reliably protected. Moreover, technology extends the boundaries in the literal sense of the word. The principles of blockchain do not depend on the state borders, which means that safe transactions on the blockchain can be performed at the international level. So, within the limits of our project the investor and the borrower can be in different ends of the earth.  The information stored on the blockchain is decentralized. This means that there is no central node that can be hacked and attack, thereby, the entire system. That is, for an effective cyber-attack, you need to hack many computers connected to a single system at once. In most cases this is not possible.  The technology of blockchain is adopted by a wide range of industries and spheres. The interaction of the blockchain with the Internet of things is a good example of how one breakthrough technology strengthens the weak spots of another.  The Internet of things is about objects that can interact with each other and with the environment, and through the connection to the network transmit information or receive instructions for action. The first example of the Internet of things in action was a toaster, which in 1990 the American John Romki switched on and off remotely. There are already a lot of “smart” things in the world. The simplest examples are the smart house systems, which allows you to warm up the dinner by the time you come home, save electricity or turn on your favorite music, and push the curtains exactly according to the schedule. Or “smart” devices that analyze information about their user and then interpret them with special software.  Their development is intensively engaged including by Apple, Google and Samsung. In fact, there are a lot more spheres where the internet of things can be developed. It not only makes life easier for people at the everyday level, but also solves more global problems. For example, one of the most important areas is the saving of natural resources.  They say (at Gartner) the Internet of things by 2020 will unite 26 billion devices. But for the time being, all these devices have a vulnerability — security. According to a study by F5 Networks, the number of attacks on IoT devices and infrastructure grew by 280% in 2017. For the most part this is due to the spread of malicious software. Hackers hack Internet devices and use them to conduct DDoS attacks and host infrastructure by trojans.  So, in 2016, the company Dyn, the operator of the DNS service, was cyber-attacked. They came, as it turned out, from the devices of the Internet of things. At first one device was infected, then the virus spread through the local network to other devices. Another example is how an American casino was nearly hacked by a “smart” aquarium. By gaining access to the aquarium, hackers scanned the entire network, and found there are new vulnerabilities.  The point is that at todays stage “smart” things are connected to centralized nodes. The more devices are connected, the more unreliable become the servers through which they exchange information.  If the devices of the world of the Internet of things become participants in a decentralized network, an attack on one of the devices will not lead to a global cyber attack on the entire server. In this case, the devices will still be able to exchange information among themselves.  So, judging by how things are going, “smart” devices will become more common in time. And the faster this world grows, the more urgent is the issue of its security. And so far, one of the most effective tools for resolving this issue is the blockchain.",False

In order for the project to be successful, our analysts keep their hands on the pulse and take into account all the current trends in our industry. And this is how the year 2017 was for the alternative lending market.  The main drivers for the development of projects in the sphere of alternative lending are innovative technologies. Alternative platforms initially could impose competition on banks due to a more flexible and convenient service. The introduction of new technologies into their processes will only strengthen the positions of alternative lending platforms. Especially since banks are also not being idle, since they are backed by large investments and opportunites.  The main vectors of improvements are user-friendliness and security. Artificial intelligence is used for quick responses to client requests. The quality of credit assessment systems is also improved. This is accomplished by, among others, the implementation of Big Data technology. And the information is processed in a variety of formats, ranging from the behavior of the potential borrower in social networks and the Internet along with the psychological evaluation of the questionnaire he filled out. In addition, in 2017, many projects announced that they are transferring their sites to a blockchain, that is, they minimize the possibility of fraud on their platforms, thereby increasing the attractiveness for investors.  The second trend, which can be noted, is the continued segmentation of the industry. In classical directions, for example, in the P2P sphere, leaders have already been outlined for a long time, it will be difficult for new players to catch up by using the same or similar business models. In turn, successful platforms are those that have a more broad target audience and at the same time some specific specialization. For example, in 2017, very popular were loans for students or people without a credit history. An increasing share of the market began to win over platforms that specialize in secured lending. Modern technologies have allowed to automate the process of assessing the collateral and withdrew the most low-risk segment of lending online.  For example, our platform SHIFT.cash deals with loans secured by car titles. Thanks to the built-in system of working with large data (Big Data) and asset tokenization (transfer of the value of the collateral to the internal cryptocurrency of the platform) we were able to fully automate the process of secured lending for a wide audience — car owners. Using blockchain technology and smart contracts in the project allows for transnational transactions, that is, opens up opportunities for the use of the platform by borrowers and investors around the world.  Another trend in the sphere of alternative lending in 2017, which will be strengthened in 2018, is entering new capital markets. There are several possibilities for this. One of them is attraction of institutional players to the platforms as investors, and even banking structures. Another format is the aggregation of disparate assets on a single platform. This strategy is also used by our platform. At present, the car loan market is represented by small and medium-sized companies all over the world. They have difficulty accessing cheap bank money, which forces them to attract more expensive private funds. With the help of the SHIFT.cash platform, the disparate small players will be able to become partners for a global system that will provide direct access to large finances consisting of investments made by thousands of investors around the world. By connecting to the SHIFT.cash system, various partners will earn much more, by increasing the amount of activity and access to global finance.",False

So, two main technologies of our platform SHIFT.cash, specializing in the provision of loans secured by car titles, are blockchain and big data. The first provides secure information storage and instantaneous transactions, including international ones. We use Big Data to automatically estimate the value of the collateral (car) based on the disparate information about the market in this or that region.  We also know that the future is not only for advanced technologies but also for their synergies. Let’s take, for example, the question of the synergy of the above-mentioned Big Data and blockchain technologies.  Large amounts of data can play and already play a role in a wide range of industries, from strategic decision making in business to application areas such as manufacturing or medicine. If you take a look at medicine, then in difficult cases, the doctor can use not only the patient’s medical history and the results testing, but also the general medical practice in this direction, taking into account the ecological situation in the patient’s place of residence, and so on, when diagnosing and prescribing treatment.  Along with the huge potential, Big Data technology has a number of unresolved problems. And one of them is a matter of information security. Risks are in the field of data reliability and the possibility of manipulating them by intruders, the loss of this information, its misuse. In other words, all this huge array of stored information, including personal and confidential, can be used for malicious purposes.  The technology of blockchain, based on a distributed data register, an open but confidential flow of transactions, can become a natural solution to this problem. As you know, information on the blockchain is almost impossible to steal or improperly modify. Thus, large amounts of data will be safe. The flow of information on the blockchain is open, but personal data is protected. And this solves the ethical issue of personal confidentiality.",False

A special place in this sense is occupied by FinTech projects, working with money at the international level. They have an increased interest from investors, since the classical instruments here are extremely inefficient and expensive because of the numerous commissions and conversion of currencies. Thus, according to the World Bank, the average cost of an international money transfer is about 7.5% (for 2015). The most expensive instrument of international transfer are banks, where the average commission value is 11.2%. The organizations dealing with money transfers have an average commission of 6.2%. Territorially the lowest level of commission takes place in South Asia. In the G20 countries, the cost of commissions is still high: from 5% in Saudi Arabia and up to 16.59% in South Africa when sending money and from 4.75% in Mexico to 9.72% in China on receipt.

As far as transnational transactions are concerned, there is a paper red tape and high commissions. Today, in the age of high technology, more comfortable times are coming. In this process, it’s not just one technology that plays its role, but none the less I’d like to single out blockchain technology. As you know, one of the main advantages of this technology is security, and this is an extremely important point in the flow of information or money abroad. The second advantage of blockchainis speed. For example, international payments and transfers take, as a rule, several days. In the case of smart contracts, this happens instantly. The third bonus is cost. If we talk about the flow of money, the commission here is minimal, especially when compared with classical instruments. If we talk about information, savings are achieved because there is no need for lawyers, notaries and other intermediaries. For example, the Austrian project SHIFT.cash specializes in issuing loans secured by car titles. This will be an international platform, directly connecting borrowers and investors from different countries. From the point of view of investors, such a project may be interesting only under the condition that all transfers are safe and secure when transferring funds, which is achieved by smart contracts. Within the framework of the project, a convenient and customary online banking interface has been developed where the investor will be able to control the loans issued in real time. In addition, the interest lies in the fact that you can lend to a person located on the other part of the world, where the rates on loans are particularly high, respectively, the demand for alternative lending is higher. So far, most of the advantages from using blockchain in international operations were taken advantage by financial and trade projects related to payments and transfers. For the financial sector, blockchain systems saves a lot of money — by cutting of jobs and accelerating all operations. But the impact of blockchain is not limited to the financial sector. For example, another very promising direction is logistics and supply chain control. For companies, this increases the efficiency of inventory management and ensures the safety of the food products supplied. The buyer of the products, in turn, can be assured of their freshness and quality: the absence of GMOs, unwanted additives and in general — compliance with the declared “on the label” information. Roughly speaking, by using blockchain, you wouldn’t be able to sell fish from the nearest river as one from the Pacific. For investors, new opportunities are opened up by tokenization of assets, that is, the transfer of the value of an object to the blockchain, just like various financial instruments work. For example, if you take precious stones, then thanks to the security that blockchain gives us, the investor can safely invest in the product, without getting it in the physical sense, which significantly simplifies the process and removes many issues related to international borders. By the way the same platform SHIFT.cash as a low-risk investment platform also could exist, thanks to tokenization. On this platform, the collateral — the car — is tokenized; therefore the risks of the investor are insured and backed up by a real asset.",False
