Everybody is clamoring for stabled prize cryptocurrency because of the volatility issues present in cryptographic assets and Minerva's idea of controlling the prize of the token might just be what will solve the problem. The reward rate system will incentivize merchants to accept the currency since reverse transaction fee goes to them which is more or less a system of sustainable cash back for the merchants.  It is a win-win for every one since the reward rate in turn will rise until it increases the total supply enough to prevent violent short-term price swings. Brilliant idea I must say! I hope the team will have everything it needs to see the project through. Projects like these should be supported by every crypto user and enthusiast,False

We’ve created the “reverse transaction fee” (sustainable cashback for merchants) and incentivized coin parking options, both of which help combat violent short-term fluctuations. We’ve created, arguably, the most commerce-friendly cryptocurrency in existence. We’ve also conceptualized $x / free trial joins rolling over into monthly subscriptions.

For the first two questions + the fourth one. The sale will be held as a sort of auction, as in, there is the total number of Tokens and everyone can contribute, after the contribution period is over, the total number of funds raised is divided by the number of Tokens sold to get the price of a single Token, serving as a mechanism of price-finding as well.  It is similar to the way NVO ran their ICO if anyone still remembers that.  Regarding pre-sale date, it will be announced, the best way to stay up to date is to register to the mailing list.

There is one bit though I can't get my head around.  For people to buy the coins they are going to have to use their mastercard or visa.  So these are still king.  If as they say they have got a platform for launch with £20 million turnover and 10 million customers.  OK I get where the platform won't have to pay any fees to visa or mastercard and will benefit from getting owl coins.  What's in it for the consumer, I take it they will still have to buy owl coins through visa or mastercard.  If they are purchasing something for £100 they may have to buy £110 worth of owl coins to cover price movements etc.  Why would they go through all that hastle if they can just buy direct using mastercard or visa.  I take it the platform will still have these options open.",False

Past, present, future.  In many high chargeback verticals such as travel, adult, dating services, nightclubs and more, cryptocurrencies already stand to save businesses money in risk mitigation. This is unrelated to of the advent of Minerva’s reverse transaction fee. Incentivizing merchants to accept cryptocurrency is what, in my opinion, will drive the positive feedback loops necessary to bring cryptocurrency mainstream. I don’t think it’s been done correctly yet.  The year was 1997, and bundled together with my enhanced Wu-Tang Forever CD was a copy of America Online. One could say it, in a literal sense, put the AOL in ShAOLin. 1997 was 5 years after Greg, a founding advisor, registered Minerva.com in 1992, 8 years after Yuji Ijiri conceptualized momentum accounting and triple-entry bookkeeping in 1989, and 12 years after Cypherpunk David Chaum published a paper referencing anonymous digital cash in 1985 — a year before I was born.  I missed out on the BBS days, but now, finally, armed with a janky PC still running Windows 3.11, I set off on a path which would ultimately lead me to a sub-culture of troublemakers. The scene, at the time, could be described as a living tribute to the 1995 movie “Hackers.” I was hooked. I met a lot of people around this time, many of whom I still keep in contact. One being Corey, Minerva’s co-founder and CTO.  The year was 2010, and I thought “Ha. Good luck with your pretend Internet money!” The year was 2013, and I thought “I need to buy Bitcoin as fast as possible.” The year was 2016, and I thought “I need to buy Ethereum as fast as possible.” The year was 2017, and I thought “I need to stand over the twitching corpses of traditional financial institutions as fast as possible.”  One step at a time, I guess.

I see that your last post was in 2014. We must have piqued your curiosity.  METAL is interesting. I will be following their progress. They seem to have an accredited team. I haven't looked into this project until today. Based on what I've gathered from their whitepaper here are some things that set us apart:  1. We're not a fiat:fiat payment system. The Owl of Minerva is a cryptocurrency and Minerva is a platform built predominately with smart contracts. 2. Minerva does not require social security numbers. 3. METAL merchants appear to pay transaction fees. Our approved merchants do not. In fact, we aim to pay transaction fees to them. It also appears that METAL merchants must purchase MTL to receive benefits. I don't see how this incentivizes ""brick and mortar"" businesses to accept cryptocurrency as described as one of their adoption goals in their whitepaper. 4. METAL doesn't appear to have a security-forward community bug bounty program potentially leaving them vulnerable to competent hackers. 5. The whitepaper mentions ""Metal will partner with an over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives dealer in order to manage currency volatility."" In terms of volatility, Minerva has incentivized mechanisms to address excessively violent short-term fluctuations. METAL mentions that volatility management is accomplished through an unspecified OTC derivatives dealer. I don't know why such a dealer would exist, which brings me to 6. According to our economic advisor, a PhD economist with 20 years of experience METAL appears to be, and I'm wording this as politely as possible because there is another term for it, unsustainable.  I would like clarification on #6 and have reached out to their CEO on Skype. If this is not the case, I will revise this post. However, if their reward rate is set to a static 5% and cannot ever reach 0%, as is not the case with Minerva, it appears reward loops, or at least value depreciation, is inevitable, and I don't envision OTC derivatives dealers taking interest and question the longevity of the project. However, METAL is optimistic and has beautiful aesthetic presentation. We wish them great success. If they would like to clarify anything I may have gotten wrong in this post, or if they need help with anything the Minerva team will make itself available to provide assistance as time permits.   you should show how you're better than your competition instead. That shouldn't be a problem.   Also, how soon will you be launching your product(BETA)? The Temple of Minerva wasn't built in a day, but the speed at which our programmers knock out complex software is almost otherworldly. For updates join the mailing list @ https://minerva.com",False
