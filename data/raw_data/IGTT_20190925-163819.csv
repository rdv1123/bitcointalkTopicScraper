Today IGT Company launches the series of analytical reviews conserning the BTC/USD and ETH/USD pairs.

If one of the levels is broken through, one might consider opening a position. The closest goal for the bulls could be the level of $6000.    The ETH / USD pair from mid-December continues to remain in the ascending channel, when approaching the level of $140 we recommend to open long positions with a stop loss at the level of $135.

The New BIG Update    IGT-CRYPTO Team finished the work on updating the platform. Not only the design has been rethought but the update has also affected the technical aspects.  The overall structure of the site was changed. We simplified the design for the purpose of better perception and added new interactive elements to the main page. Now you can see the current prices of cryptocurrencies, 24 hour price change, the number of active users and the daily turnover without even logging in to your account.    2. The formation of the trading pool has also been reorganized. Now it has become much more intuitive and informative.    A limit buy order(buy limit) is an order to buy a currency at a specified price or lower (because the buyer wants the price to be as low as possible). The buy limit order is set at a price that is lower than the current market. The trader uses this type order in case he expects the price to go lower at first, but then, after reaching a certain level, the trice will go up again.  A limit sell order(sell limit) is an application to sell a currency at a specified price or higher. The sell limit order is set at a price that is higher than the current market price. The trader uses this type order when he expects the price to go up, but then, after reaching a certain level, the price will go down under the resistance level.    3. The speed of matching and processing user requests was substantially increased.  One of the key aspects in the work of IGT-CRYPTO exchange is the speed of applications’ execution. We chose a combined approach in the data storage and processing which implies using both centralized and decentralized systems. The use of the Websocket interface allows us to achieve high processing speeds. Our model is flexible to scale and is ready to work with a large amount of data. In the future, this model will be modified according to the technological solutions that will be presented in the world and accepted by our company.  4. We have integrated SEPA into IGT-CRYPTO as one of the ways to transfer fiat EUR TO and FROM the Exchange with minimum fees;  The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) will allow our customers to make euro payments throughout Europe as easily, securely and efficiently as possible.     5. The Security on IGT-CRYPTO was taken to another level. Now 95% of all funds are stored on cold wallets. This makes hacking attempts pretty much senseless and guarantees the safety of financial capital.  6. Some new technical features concerning the account management have been added.  7. Now we support corporate accounts.    Investment funds and financial companies can now open a special corporate account on our exchange. IGT-CRYPTO can also be connected as a liquidity aggregator to other exchanges.  https://medium.com/@IGTCRYPTO/igt-crypto-the-new-big-update-b8a30b45cae8",False

We discussed the regional features of local markets of Europe and China. Shared our views on the characteristics with which projects should comply in order to have the real investment appeal on the markets of Asia and worldwide.  Thanks to the unbiased understanding of the situation which this meeting gave us, we were able to reconsider the vectors of effective international marketing of our Platform.

Security of data transmission: Our team seriously approached the issue of safe storage and data backup, ensuring the maximum level of protection of transmitted data. a) Security of data transmission is provided by two factors: 1. Using SSL as the main layer for data transfer; 2. Application of http/2 technology on the server side increases not only performance, but also a level of security. б) We use only complex keys for internal data transfer, the whole transfer within the infrastructure is carried out with using RSA encryption (US Pat. No. 4,405,829) 2. Security of Logging In is provided by two levels of verification: a) Verification of user data by authorization Signature is a HMAC-SHA256 encoded message containing nonce, customer ID and API key. The HMAC-SHA256 code must be generated using a secret key that was generated with your API key. This code must be converted to it’s hexadecimal representation (64 uppercase characters). б) Abstraction of the method of hashing passwords: The present invention is a device for and method of generating a hash value for a message by padding the message, loading the padded message into a first shift register that generates values according to a first rule of motion, initializing eight registers a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h with user-definable values; converting the contents of the registers to: hj=gj−1; gj=fj−1; fj=ej−1; ej=dj−1+T1, where T1=hj−1+Σ1(ej−1)+Ch(ej−1, fj−1, gj−1)+Kj+Wj; dj=cj−1; cj=bj−1; bj=aj−1; и aj=T1+T2, where T2=Σ0(aj−1)+Maj(aj−1, bj−1, cj−1); computing: H1(j)=a+H1(j−1); H2(j)=b+H2(j−1); H3(j)=c+H3(j−1); H4(j)=d+H4(j−1); H5(j)=e+H5(j−1); H6(j)=f+H6(j−1); H7(j)=g+H7(j−1); и H8(j)=h+H8(j−1); and either performing additional conversions of the registers or returning (H1(j), H2(j), H3(j), H4(j), H5(j), H6(j), H7(j), H8(j)) as the hash value of the message. 3. Data Storage To ensure the highest possible level of security for our clients, we addressed the issue of improving the quality of data storage. For this purpose, we are developing a combined decentralized system. a. Storage of personal data By using the cryptosystem aes128, the data is stored in an encrypted form. b. The storage of documents Is also protected by an additional level of hashing of the disk structure, which makes it impossible to predict a series of documents. c. Distribution of data We do not store all information on one server, the information is shared between the storage server and the database server. d. Storage of private keys Our system allows for distributed key storage on services with increased security. The distribution of information occurs between the services x, y. AES: high-level struscture e. Encryption of PGP data We started implementing an additional level of security - PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption to ensure confidentiality and authentication of the files that you upload / send to us. f. Data backup IGT-CRYPTO is equipped with two levels of data reservation, which allows to save both earlier events and the recent ones.  source: https://igt-crypto.io/documents/en/whitepaper.pdf  Do you understand this shprotman29? it's good or not?",False
