There are no apps or platforms that currently do this. As you can imagine, it took quite a bit of time and resources to develop.  You won't find much press on it, as we existed in dev mode, spending minimal on marketing only to test features and UI.

We are still determining this.  We recognize that token holders want to be able to trade their tokens and that certain exchanges might end up listing/trading our token independent of any direct request or solicitation from us.  Q2) Is there a function in the smart contract for freezing tokens on adressess that will allow controlling the moment of entry to the exchange in order to avoid uncontrolled sale of tokens on decentralized exchanges and the collapse of the token price. We're very aware and are strategizing the best way(s) to create stability.  There are multiple options that we're considering.  We strongly believe in the strength of the Blinked project (with an existing product and audience of 13k already who joined while we were in dev) and it’s use case, so we're confident that we'll be able to support the token value through both milestone achievements and strategy.  At the end of the day, performance will be our best hedge again volatility and we have a solid team to support the success of the platform. We're also the only social media platform for recommendations (on anything) that will drive up to 90 percent of advertising revenue to users, so we've got a strong leg to stand on.  Q3) I saw that the distribution of tokens to bounty members is planned only a month after the end of ICO. Why so long ? The best answer here is directly related to your last question ---> stability.
