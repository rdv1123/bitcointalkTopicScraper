Play and earn game rewards with real world value!  Telegram Group |Telegram Announcement | BountyThread | Website | Twitter | Facebook| _______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________  About Bitney Bitney is a company that is developing Beeznix the game. In conjuction with that, Bitney is partnering with many established, revenue gerating bee farms to help cultivate and educate beekeepers and businesses. Bitney has a Community Service Reserve (CSR) fund to help educate and promote beekeeping activities. We believe that the decline of bees is a serious problem and poses a huge risk to the future of earth. Bees are an irreplaceable force of nature, without which many plants and trees will fail to pollinate and subsequently be at risk of extinction. Through our CSR, bee farms and Beeznix the game we hope to promote and educate the world on the importance of bees and uptake our role as protectors of bees. With our different initiatives working together in synergy, we believe our token, business and game will be able to generate immense value and propagate our mission and vision to many more people. Together, we will be able to ensure that we will be able to partake in this incredible mission to save our little furry striped friends.  As a utility token, Bitney tokens are used to purchase in-game assets such as erc-721 cards, staked in tournaments and much more. Players are able to earn Bitney tokens through playing and winning the Beeznix games. Players are also able to ""lose"" their Bitney on the game platform if they are not careful. With cunning and skill players battle each other to gain an edge in Beeznix the Honeyverse. Beeznix as a game is a great marketing and fun effort to push out Bitney's mission. Profits from the sale of honey used to buyback Bitney tokens. From this buyback, 20% of the tokens are burned, and 80% is redeposited into the Beeznix Game Rewards Bank. Beeznix Game Rewards are used to incentivise and fund tournaments for the community. Problems & Solutions  1) Problem:An increasing global demand for honey and insufficient supply of raw honey.  Solution:Profits generated from a mobile game accelerates expansion of honey farms. A global outreach program will help educate farm owners and optimize hives and maximize honey outputs. Provenance of honey generated from project Beeznix can be tracked using a decentralized ledger to prevent bootlegging.  2) Problem: Many cryptocurrencies are at risk of eventual devaluation from lack of a sustainable revenue model.  Solution: Bitney is built off an established, revenue generating honey business.Profits from honey sales are used to purchase Bitney tokens from exchanges. From this buyback, 20% of the tokens are burned, and 80% is redeposited into the Beeznix Game Rewards Bank. This cycle safeguards Bitney’s value.  3) Problem: Limited playability and portability of game skins.  Solution: Bluepz utilizes the ERC720 token standard to create crypto game assets such as skins, gold and accessories that are transferrable between players, combinable with other game assets and usable across multiple games / game modes. Bluepz can also be sold for Bitney at our community market.  4) Problem: Undisclosed drop rates and proof of provenance for purchasable digital assets.  Solution: Using a viewable algorithm that always generates a randomized drop rate, our drops for ‘mystery’ assets are provably fair. Bluepz are recorded on a decentralized registry, and asset ownership trails can be viewed via the block explorer.  5) Problem: Lack of digital assets that can act as collateral for peer-to-peer microfinancing  Solution: Ruled by market demand and scarcity, each Bluep holds its own price and can act as a digital collateral for loans between players. Lenders choose to offer loans based on their perceived valuation of the offered collateral and decides on interest rates. Smart contracts execute terms for the movement of funds and the escrow of the collateral.  6) Problem: Players spend time, effort and money on games, but get no real-world rewards  Solution: The Beeznix game lets players earn Bitney rewards for playing and amassing in-game resources. Players can exchange Bitney for major cryptocurrencies at exchanges listing Bitney. The Beeznix Rewards Bank is funded by actual honey sales profits.  7) Problem: Gas fees and transaction times make ERC721 gaming directly on Ethereum unfeasible.  Solution: Beeznix operates on a sidechain, where the player’s preauthorized game wallet is subject to the game’s smart contract rules, allowing fast and free movement of ERC721 game assets and autonomous changes of ownership. This opens up a whole world of possibilities for development of more intricate gameplays involving non-fungible token assets (NFTs).
