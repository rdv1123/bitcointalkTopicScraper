EXCHAIN is a blockchain based and decentralised application which intends to  use EnvisionX Tokens (“EXT”) to execute digital advertising with end-to-end ad  spend transparency, fraud-free advertising inventory and real time payment processing.  EXT will become the new digital advertising currency for decentralized digital advertising.  All ad spend, fees and commissions will be transacted in EXT and the total supply of EXT tokens will be limited.  EXCHAIN will be built with certain modules opensourced to encourage  the involvement of the general advertising communities at a greater level.    EXCHAIN is a blockchain-based platform that will turn a significant proportion of the $228.44 billion dollar digital ad spend into immutable proof of evidence chains for end-to-end (“E2E”) transparent and fraud-free advertising. It enables all advertisers to execute digital advertising campaigns with fully tracked,  verified and audited ad spend on clean advertising inventory sources.  For publishers and service providers EXCHAIN replaces the traditional insertion order mechanism to allow  real time processing of revenue payment.      Advertisements Advertising is the key method that is adopted by advertisers and brands to promote their products to consumers and make sure that their product  is seen through the clutter of the products and advertised promotional material.  To stand out and be able to attract consumers, advertisers try to apply various campaign strategies to maximize the advertising outcome.  Over the past decade, the digital advertising space has adopted programmatic advertising technology which enables marketers to utilize  big data computing and cloud computing to deliver more relevant and accurate advertisements. However, the automated and machine-based digital advertising technologies have created challenges of trust and transparency in the ad spend and greater scale of fraudulent advertising inventory. The recent development of blockchain technology has lightened up the possibility  to help the digital advertising industry to tackle the transparency and fraud challenges by revealing the ad spend flow distributed. Advertising as being formulated today through BlockChain Today, Blockchain technology has enabled a new and much more compact and beneficial technical setup for advertisers to promote their products in a trustful and transparent way. The blockchain technology helps eliminating the unauthorized intermediaries who are sitting on the ad value chain today and blocks the unauthorised ad spend from being taken out from the ad chain. The blockchain-based digital advertisement ecosystem transforms the current centralized digital ad space into a decentralized ecosystem through storing the ad events and ad spend on the tamper- free public ledgers. It has not been possible in the past for an advertiser to gain such transparency  and trust without the blockchain technology. It is still early stage of applying the blockchain technology in digital advertising space today. Being the first of its kind, the Exchain blockchain digital advertising platform aims to revolutionize the digital ad space to an unprecedented level of trust and transparency. The Exchain platform highlights and focuses on addressing below two challenges: Improves Ad Spend Transparency The Exchain platform provides full coverage of ad spend transparency using decentralized storage. It stores all event logs for easy auditing, and enables immutable proof of spend and impression evidence and provenance for transparent advertising. Fraud Protection The Exchain platform uses the decentralised ad spend distribution mechanism to prevent revenue from being taken by fraudsters out of the ad value chain. Fraudulent operators will not have access to a revenue receive gateway in the Exchain. Reasons for Blockchain based digital advertisements success Digital advertising had a strong year on year growth in the past decade at the global scale and it’s projected to continue growing. With the introduction of the blockchain technology into the advertising space, the Exchain platform is envisioned to transform the current digital advertising space into a greener and more efficient ecosystem in the following years.

Thank you for your question. Actually the EXCHAIN platform will completely revolutionise how digital advertising is conducted today at a globle scale. With its key focus being ad spend transparency, it disrupted the current paper IO based campaign delivery and the linear distribution of the advertising spend to be digital smart contract based and decentralized distribution of the ad spend. This enables advertisers to gain 100% transparency of their ad spend, eliminate unauthorized intermediaries, and remove certain types of frauds. This revolution will also transform the existing commercial terms between advertisers and publishers. The EXCHAIN platform enables the real time payment to be made to publishers whilst today publishers have to bear a financial risk of being paid on 30 days net, or 45 days net or even 120 days net terms.  The EXCHAIN platform will also combine the power of blockchain technology and EnvisionX’s existing programmatic advertising technology to offer the ultimate autonomous vehicle for cost-efficient campaign delivery, verification and settlement. The EXCHAIN platform is meticulously designed to be easily accessible and open for all advertising stakeholders to obtain the benefits of transparency, anti-fraud and real-time payment processing. It’s design also allows all stakeholders to use the platform without having to modify their existing systems to be blockchain compatible.  If you need more information, please let  me know.",False
