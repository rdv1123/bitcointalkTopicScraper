Our aim is to fix all those issues in a form of an ultimate solution that will not only significantly decrease expenses for every market participant but also make it a less time consuming process overall.   Managing of Influencer Marketing programs is currently a very challenging process and Influencer Marketing platforms, or agencies, require an advertiser to pay up to 50% commission for such services. With the help of our services, brands can expect to reduce the costs associated with launching Influencer Marketing campaigns significantly.   Our solution offers an easy, efficient, fast and secure way for brands and influencers to connect, agree upon the terms of a smart contact, create quality content and process the payment. Our service will also guarantee protection from scam and will see to it that the terms of the smart contact are met by both sides. No agents will be needed to materialize all of the above, but even in case one wishes to delegate duties to agents, they will get fees from our side and not from the influencer or advertiser.  All of the above will grant a significant reduction of the cost of marketing activities for those who will join SocialMedia.Market  By the way we already launched the beta version of our platform, so you have an ability to check it. You will see changes and updates during the ICO campaign. Our R&D department do not stop working on it. For sure, launch version will have mass of features implemented, which are still on development stage or have not been released in current version.  Please, check beta here: https://beta.socialmedia.market/   Thank you so much for your support!

THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT!🔥,"HOW TO FIND INFLUENCERS IN YOUR NICHE?  Finding the right influencer for an ad campaign is quite an issue. To begin with, their audience should be potentially interested in your product, so a blogger's channel should be close to the subject of your brand. For example, if you are promoting a cosmetics store, look for lifestyle or beauty bloggers. Their followers are your target audience. But how to find the right influencer? Here are several tips to help you solve this issue. 1. Do a Google Search for Local Bloggers. This short research will help you find experts in your niche. When you have a list of opinion leaders specializing in your topic, check their audience and channel content. This will help you choose the most suitable influencer in the future. 2. Check your own followers. A great way to find influencers is to analyze your own followers. Perhaps you have thematic bloggers who already have subscribed on your pages and use your product or service. If the influencer is interested in your brand, it will be much easier and cheaper to start advertising with him. 3. Look for a thematic hashtag. Bloggers often use thematic hashtags to simplify the search. Identify the most niche tags and check them in social networks. Of course, this analysis takes some time, but in the end you will be able to recruit several influencers for efficient promotion. 4. Grow your own micro-influencer network. Almost everyone has a profile in various of social networks, your team included. Analyze their profiles - maybe some will have a large enough audience that suits your goals. Moreover, your team members know the product well and can tell a lot about it.  We also recommend you to read our article ""What your boss would like to know about influencer marketing"", in which answers on the frequent questions about this marketing area: https://medium.com/socialmedia-market/what-your-boss-would-like-to-know-about-influencer-marketing-c9568ada5478",False

THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT!🔥,"   Hello! Thank you for your feedback and your question!  First of all, let me say that our project is not about all advertising on the Internet. The field we work in is influencer marketing.  Influencer Marketing is about content, created by bloggers and published in social media networks like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc. This kind of content gives marketers a wide range of application. From straight forward advertisement of a product to creation of a social conversation around their brand. Influencer Marketing is a growing market, which will reach $5-$10B till end of 2020. And like any market on the stage of development, Influencer Marketing has several core issues that stagger its development. Being early adopters of the strategy (since 2015), we have experienced these issues ourselves. We have faced fraud, uncertain pricing, high overall fees, complex interaction, and complicated global payments. The general idea behind the SocialMedia.Market project is to solve these major issues with Blockchain and Smart Contracts technologies. This new tech allows to create a safe, transparent, and decentralized platform for managing and measuring Influencer Marketing for everyone anywhere.  There are platforms operating in the same industry as we do. Nevertheless, SocialMedia.Market clearly stands out due to several core differences. The main difference here is in the approach. We are creating SocialMedia.Market as an independent and decentralized ecosystem, designed as a solution for online advertising market challenges. It will bring influencer marketing to a whole new level, providing a convenient solution for advertisers and a reliable source of income for bloggers, all in a single marketplace. Bringing blockchain to the core of the platform, we are building transparent, secure, fair and trustable ecosystem for every market participant. SocialMedia.Market is a platform that will open the gateway to Influencer Marketing for everyone. We are focused on every major social network, not fixing our efforts on just one or few of them. It will allow bloggers worldwide to get a bite at global online advertising budgets. As for the advertisers, we believe that the opportunities of this strategy are not limited to the brands with huge budgets. Influencer Marketing is extremely effective for businesses of any size, online and offline. SocialMedia.Market will become the marketplace to satisfy specific needs of any advertiser. And this is why we are implementing blockchain and smart contract technologies here. We want to create a flexible and adjustable system, unhindered by limitations of existing solutions.  Also, answering your question, it’s impossible not to dwell upon Social Media Token (SMT) which is designed to be the currency of SocialMedia.Market ecosystem, facilitating fund transfers between business, influencers or agents. Basically, SMT is the internal currency of the platform and it will ensure transactions, data validity, campaign and contract creation. So, you can easily pay with SMT for influencers campaigns or vice versa. Here's a short list of advantages SMT will provide to all parties as a single currency: -100% safe escrow transactions based on Blockchain technology -Low-cost transactions with less operation fees -Simplified and fast global payments -Earn rewards by participating in the decentralized dispute solution system -Utility tool for acquiring outstanding marketing services, premium analytics and development instruments   If you have any more questions, do not hesitate to write us here. Our team will try to unfold any details you want to know. Please consider getting acquainted with the White Paper  Also, here is our short presentation of the project which contains all the most important information about us and will allow you to get a more clear general idea about our service.",False

Managing of Influencer Marketing programs is currently a very challenging process and Influencer Marketing platforms, or agencies, require an advertiser to pay up to 50% commission for such services. With the help of our services, brands can expect to reduce the costs associated with launching Influencer Marketing campaigns significantly. Our solution offers an easy, efficient, fast and secure way for brands and influencers to connect, agree upon the terms of a smart contact, create quality content and process the payment. Our service will also guarantee protection from scam and will see to it that the terms of the smart contact are met by both sides. No agents will be needed to materialize all of the above, but even in case one wishes to delegate duties to agents, they will get fees from our side and not from the influencer or advertiser. All of the above will grant a significant reduction of the cost of marketing activities for those who will join SocialMedia.Market and also will create ecosystem where influencers can easily access sponsorship for creating good quality content.

Flexibility and readiness to take new challenges increases the chance of success in this ""dog-eat-dog world""  Our team have tremendous experience in influencer marketing from the brand’s perspective and we ourselves know exactly what the main obstacles for effectiveness in this field are. We are creating a service that we wish would be out there for us as a brand and we know about all the problems that influencers come across when trying to monetize their channel (blog, page, etc), too. Our aim is to fix all those issues in a form of an ultimate solution that will not only significantly decrease expenses for every market participant but also make it a less time consuming process overall.   Managing of Influencer Marketing programs is currently a very challenging process and Influencer Marketing platforms, or agencies, require an advertiser to pay up to 50% commission for such services. With the help of our services, brands can expect to reduce the costs associated with launching Influencer Marketing campaigns significantly.   Our solution offers an easy, efficient, fast and secure way for brands and influencers to connect, agree upon the terms of a smart contact, create quality content and process the payment. Our service will also guarantee protection from scam and will see to it that the terms of the smart contact are met by both sides. No agents will be needed to materialize all of the above, but even in case one wishes to delegate duties to agents, they will get fees from our side and not from the influencer or advertiser.  All of the above will grant a significant reduction of the cost of marketing activities for those who will join SocialMedia.Market  So as you can see the future is now and the platform you talked about is already on beta development stage;) It planned to be released in February 2018.

Quote from: Pipshunter on November 30, 2017, 12:01:50 PM i have a questions , how this projects gonna change our perspective in others social media such as facebook and twitter? what kind of benefits we get from this project/platform ? what your platform offers us than others ico projects?    Hello!  Thank you for your question and for your interest in our project!  The general idea behind the SocialMedia.Market project is to solve these major issues with Blockchain and Smart Contracts technologies. This new tech allows to create a safe, transparent, and decentralized platform for managing and measuring Influencer Marketing for everyone anywhere.  Social Media Token (SMT) is designed to be the currency of SocialMedia.Market ecosystem, facilitating fund transfers between business, influencers or agents. Basically, SMT is the internal currency of the platform and it will ensure transactions, data validity, campaign and contract creation. So you can easily pay with SMT for influencers campaigns or vice versa.  SocialMedia.Market clearly stands out from other similar ICO projects due to several core differences. The main difference here is in the approach. We are creating SocialMedia.Market as an independent and decentralized ecosystem, designed as a solution for online advertising market challenges, not only internal issues with bank compliance. It will bring influencer marketing to a whole new level, providing a convenient solution for advertisers and a reliable source of income for bloggers, all in a single marketplace.  Bringing blockchain to the core of the platform and implementing smart contracts, we are building transparent, secure, flexible, adjustable, fair and trustable ecosystem for every market participant. Our platform will be opened for bloggers and influencers from every major social network (Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitch, etc) and advertisers of any kind: applications, stores, services, brands, small and middle local businesses and anyone interested in promoting their product via Influencer Marketing.   If you have any more questions, do not hesitate to write us here. Our team will unfold any details you want to know.",False

That's really nice one    So market strategy for advertisers won’t be limited by geo, social network or any other means. For example, if you are running a webservice from Chicago, but your main audience located in LATAM, you can easily find relevant influencer there. You will need to target the campaign to preferred countries, set audience language, age, interests, influencers’ channel size, audience engagement rate etc. After campaign will be created smart matching system will offer you list of influencers opened for business opportunities and meeting your requirements. Or you can run platform's search engine, using your specific criteria. In anyway, SocialMedia.Market will give an opportunity to interact with influencers, bloggers and streamers worldwide using precise tools for finding relevant advertising channels, giving biggest exposure to your marketing campaigns. As for attracting influencers to the platform: after launching the platform, we will focus on attracting advertisers during brand awareness campaign. Bringing marketing budgets on the platform will open business and monetization opportunities for influencers of all kinds. Open and transparent marketplace and not the agency-like model, is the key to continuous business relationships between advertisers and influencers.  We I hope that we answered your question. But don't hesitate to contact us if you have any additional questions;) We will be happy to provide you with any details!",False

THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT!🔥,"   Hello!  Thank you for your question and for your interest in our project!  So let me explain the difference between SocialMedia.Market and Adnetwork. SocialMedia.Market is a platform, designed for Influencer Marketing. Influencer Marketing is about content, created by bloggers and published in social media networks like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc. This kind of content gives marketers a wide range of application. From straight forward advertisement of a product to creation of a social conversation around their brand.  From a brief research on Adnetwork, it looks like they are building an “Advertising network” on Blockchain. That’s a completely different business model – they connect advertisers with websites willing to host advertisements. Mainly advertising networks work with banners.  Social Media Token (SMT) is designed to be the currency of SocialMedia.Market ecosystem, facilitating fund transfers between business, influencers or agents. Basically, SMT is the internal currency of the platform and it will ensure transactions, data validity, campaign and contract creation. So you can easily pay with SMT for influencers campaigns or vice versa. Here's a short list of advantages SMT will provide to all parties as a single currency: 100% safe escrow transactions based on Blockchain technology; low-cost transactions with less operation fees; simplified and fast global payments; earn rewards by participating in the decentralized dispute solution system; utility tool for acquiring outstanding marketing services; premium analytics and development instruments.  We I hope that we answered your question and all is clear for now. But don't hesitate to contact us if you have any additional questions;) We will be happy to provide you with any details!",False

Though, with the team and the plan we have, no obstacles are strong enough to stop us. We know exactly how to overcome them and even to use them to our advantage.  As I explained in one of the messages above, we are creating a marketplace to fix every significant issue that both the influencer and the brand currently meet on their way to creating quality content. And the hurdles in this market are the same for everybody, even for such giants as Coca-Cola, Nike and Apple. They know best about the immense power and potential of influencer marketing and they’ve been using it for years now. There is no doubt they will apply to it even more in their future marketing campaigns, and having a service to make all their social media marketing activities more efficient, convenient and faster gives them all a clear improvement with absolutely no risk. It will take them less time and cost to discover, create, run and analyze advertising campaigns with social media influencers using our marketplace.  We are building a transparent, secure, fair, trustable and easy-to-use ecosystem and every reasonable brand seeking promotion with social media marketing will join us just because we will make their life easier and better.

We have tremendous experience in influencer marketing from the brand’s perspective and we ourselves know exactly what the main obstacles for effectiveness in this field are. We are creating a service that we wish would be out there for us as a brand and we know about all the problems that influencers come across when trying to monetize their channel (blog, page, etc), too. Our aim is to fix all those issues in a form of an ultimate solution that will not only significantly decrease expenses for every market participant but also make it a less time consuming process overall.   Managing of Influencer Marketing programs is currently a very challenging process and Influencer Marketing platforms, or agencies, require an advertiser to pay up to 50% commission for such services. With the help of our services, brands can expect to reduce the costs associated with launching Influencer Marketing campaigns significantly.  Our solution offers an easy, efficient, fast and secure way for brands and influencers to connect, agree upon the terms of a smart contact, create quality content and process the payment. Our service will also guarantee protection from scam and will see to it that the terms of the smart contact are met by both sides. No agents will be needed to materialize all of the above, but even in case one wishes to delegate duties to agents, they will get fees from our side and not from the influencer or advertiser. All of the above will grant a significant reduction of the cost of marketing activities for those who will join SocialMedia.Market   Thanks for the clarification. But I join to question above : ""Will your platform reduce relevance of the advertising agents on market down to zero? "" It seems that when you will launch your platform at full power, there are will be no place for agents in common role like they are now. In that case I dont think these people will support the development of your product.. Correct me if Im wrong.  Yes, there is a bounty campaign that you may learn about and join following this link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2321059.0 Also, please join our Telegram chat and the chat dedicated to the bounty campaign as well  Now I’d like to clarify the role of agents in our project. Our service will indeed be good enough for brands and influencers to effectively interact and manage campaigns without a need for agents. However, we realize that a number of companies and influencers prefer to handle their business via agents and will continue to do so. That’s why we will make it possible for them to be represented by agents. SocialMedia.Market will also provide opportunities in extra earnings for market platform agencies. Any agent will be able to become a partner of the service and receive commission in Social Media Tokens for the provision of additional services for advertisers’ marketing campaigns or become a personal manager to influencers. We emphasize that the commission fee paid to the agents will come from our end and not the pocket of influencers or advertisers. The platform will be a convenient tool for searching and managing business opportunities. With the help of service agents, one can easily manage the schedule of advertising content or check effectiveness of advertising campaigns using the extended set of tools, anytime and anywhere.",False

We are the first decentralized ecosystem to discover, create, run and analyze advertising campaigns with social media influencers.   We will bring influencer marketing to a whole new level, providing a convenient solution for advertisers and a reliable source of income for bloggers, all in a single marketplace. Bringing blockchain to the core of the platform, we are building transparent, secure, fair and trustable ecosystem for every market participant. SocialMedia.Market is a platform that will open the gateway to Influencer Marketing for everyone. We are going to work with every major social network, not limiting our efforts on just one or two of them. It will allow bloggers worldwide, small and big, to be a crucial part of global online advertising process.  As for the advertisers, we believe that the opportunities of our solution are not limited to the brands with huge budgets. Influencer marketing is extremely effective for businesses of any size, online and offline.

THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT!🔥,"  We have tremendous experience in influencer marketing from the brand’s perspective and we ourselves know exactly what the main obstacles for effectiveness in this field are. We are creating a service that we wish would be out there for us as a brand and we know about all the problems that influencers come across when trying to monetize their channel (blog, page, etc), too. Our aim is to fix all those issues in a form of an ultimate solution that will not only significantly decrease expenses for every market participant but also make it a less time consuming process overall.   Managing of Influencer Marketing programs is currently a very challenging process and Influencer Marketing platforms, or agencies, require an advertiser to pay up to 50% commission for such services. With the help of our services, brands can expect to reduce the costs associated with launching Influencer Marketing campaigns significantly.  Our solution offers an easy, efficient, fast and secure way for brands and influencers to connect, agree upon the terms of a smart contact, create quality content and process the payment. Our service will also guarantee protection from scam and will see to it that the terms of the smart contact are met by both sides. No agents will be needed to materialize all of the above, but even in case one wishes to delegate duties to agents, they will get fees from our side and not from the influencer or advertiser. All of the above will grant a significant reduction of the cost of marketing activities for those who will join SocialMedia.Market",False

THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT!🔥,"  First of all, thank you for the question. Let me clarify the difference between SocialMedia.Market and Adnetwork. SocialMedia.Market is a platform, designed for Influencer Marketing. Influencer Marketing is about content, created by bloggers and published in social media networks like Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc. This kind of content gives marketers a wide range of application. From straight forward advertisement of a product to creation of a social conversation around their brand. Influencer Marketing is a growing market, which will reach $5-$10B till end of 2020. And like any market on the stage of development, Influencer Marketing has several core issues that stagger its development. Being early adopters of the strategy (since 2015), we have experienced these issues ourselves. We have faced fraud, uncertain pricing, high overall fees, complex interaction, and complicated global payments. The general idea behind the SocialMedia.Market project is to solve these major issues with Blockchain and Smart Contracts technologies. This new tech allows to create a safe, transparent, and decentralized platform for managing and measuring Influencer Marketing for everyone anywhere. From a brief research on Adnetwork, it looks like they are building an “Advertising network” on Blockchain. That’s a completely different business model – they connect advertisers with websites willing to host advertisements. Mainly advertising networks work with banners.  Social Media Token (SMT) is designed to be the currency of SocialMedia.Market ecosystem, facilitating fund transfers between business, influencers or agents. Basically, SMT is the internal currency of the platform and it will ensure transactions, data validity, campaign and contract creation. So, you can easily pay with SMT for influencers campaigns or vice versa. Here's a short list of advantages SMT will provide to all parties as a single currency: 100% safe escrow transactions based on Blockchain technology Low-cost transactions with less operation fees Simplified and fast global payments Earn rewards by participating in the decentralized dispute solution system Utility tool for acquiring outstanding marketing services, premium analytics and development instruments",False
