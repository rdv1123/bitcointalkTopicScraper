Why would anyone invest in ICOs when they can just buy on Vertex? Also your team will obviously profit on reselling tokens, which you would get at a lesser price, and then sell on your own market, but knowing that it will offput private investors even more basically dumping ICO token price below what early birds paid on psale, which means nobody would even want to buy at that point. You may say that you will be selling psale tokens on your market to counter that, but that actually is even worse, it invalidates a point of psale completely. And invalidates ICO to a point of irrelevance, which is the end removes your project from the market because its only usecase(reselling ICOs) stops existing.

Our vision Our vision is to create an ecosystem within the ICO market to increase its reputation and help non-accredited investors to invest in this thriving market. Vertex will become THE aftermarket and source for tokens either  1.) For non-listed utility and security tokens 2.) Tokens that are not listed yet but will be soon 3.) Listed tokens  Vertex is a major player. The Vertex market attracts Funds and Venture capitalists and offers them an exit of an ICO, without the need to sell the tokens on an exchange and hurting the project. On the other side, it attracts hundreds of thousands of users that want to buy evaluated, great tokens for a lower price then it was sold, or it is traded on exchanges.  Vertex Public Sale Info START DATE 01.10.2018  END DATE 15.02.2019   MARKET  The market platform grants users access to sold-out ICO tokens or ICO tokens that are no longer for sale without the need to be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. The users will benefit from preferential prices and allow them to buy into highly evaluated, promising tokens.  The market is decentralized and all a user has to do is transfer VTEX tokens from his wallet of choice to an address given by the tool. Vertex validates if the sender address is registered for this user and once validated, the tokens will be sent directly to his wallet.  Vertex.market will change the way the ICO lifecycle works. The Investment consortium behind vertex has high liquidity but will continuously onboard other Funds, VCs and Family offices to join the ecosystem and increase the overall liquidity.  WHY VERTEX WORKS  01.) Time to Exchange ICOs that closed their public funding (if applicable) will increasingly have longer between the end of ICO and their exchange listing. This is a good development since there is no logical reason, a freshly funded business should be subject to speculation. Vertex.Market fills this gap  2.) Exchange, not the right instrument An exchange is a place where established business should be traded, not a 5-month-old start-up. However, contributors that missed the crowd-sale, now have the opportunity to buy these tokens at preferential prices before it launches on an exchange.  3.) Exit door for VC’s and Funds If an ICO did not plan to get listed on exchanges, most VC’s and Capital Investors would not perform an investment because they don’t have an exit-door. Vertex.Market offers the perfect exit-door, without pressuring the price of the token.  4.) A boost for every ICO Every ICO would like to be evaluated, listed and provided with investments. The Vertex platform has high liquidity through its investors and partners.  The Vertex vetting process rules out scams and projects that are not yet ready, which in turn gives contributors and Vertex token holders a clear advantage in the market.  5.) All Private Sale ICOs Many ICOs that have a high chance of success are usually not sold publicly, which means ordinary people would not get access to these tokens at ICO prices. The Vertex Platform changes this by buying into successfully vetted ICOs in private sale phase and then offering the tokens to the public on the Vertex.Market platform. The Vertex token market will be the first ICO aftermarket which offers ICOs investment opportunities or access to its investment consortium, which is a substantial advantage that is more than just an investment.  The community gains a new instrument and a new way of buying ICO tokens they can trust, for lower cost.  Funds and VCs finally get a second way of selling part of their investment and no longer have to force the ICO to conduct a fast exchange listing and buyback of their own tokens. Meet the team!
