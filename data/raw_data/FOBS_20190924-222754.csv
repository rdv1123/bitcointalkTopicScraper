MediaDom is a major partner of the largest telecom operator - Megafon!   Objective of the project Our goal is to develop level and size of MediaDom up to the federal one, to exceed the company's profit over 4 billion rubles a year and provide an opportunity for each investor to receive a constant profit from the Fobscoin project up to 1300% for each purchased FOBS token.   Financial indicators Our company already has got a subscriber database of more than 3000 subscribers, and annual revenues of more than 40 million rubles. At achievement of the purposes on investment the user's base will make more than 500 000 thousand subscribers, and the annual gain is expected as 5 billion rubles or more in a year.   The project team To create, launch and realize the Fobscoin project we attracted the best team and partners of MediaDom. Our team has got the best specialists in the field of communications who have already helped to improve the company MediaDom to reach excellent financial indicators and have created FOBS, getting all safety and security from our project partner - CrowdHub. This was created by the Russian Association of Crypto-Currency and Blockchain "" Rakib "".   Our technologies We use the best modern wireless data transmission technology AirMax, which allows one to transfer high-speed Internet for a distance of more than 200 km with an Internet connection speed of more than 2 gigabits per second. The technology AirMax developed by Ubiquiti Networks. This technology, managed by the company MediaDom in Russia, has already helped thousands to get high-speed internet, we have not stopped at what we have achieved and launched the Fobscoin project. Fobscoin - technology available to everyone!   Enter to the stock exchange We did not focus on one income opportunity for each investor, so each investor will have a choice - to receive dividends or sell a token on the stock exchange. Capitalization of all equipment and each connected subscriber is originally put in the token.    Internet in Russia In our country, the high-speed Internet service for private households is not developed at all. Having big houses people live there without modern technologies. And in this area, MediaDom solves the problem and is ready to provide every residential or commercial home with a high-speed Internet service. Our country needs such a project to solve numerous problems regarding private households and state enterprises, especially those that are located in the countryside and experience a lack of modern technological capabilities.    Pre-ICO and ICO Please pay your attention to the fact that there are a few days remain until the end of the Pre-ICO and a reliable capitalized FOBS token can be purchased at a discount until May 1, 2018. For those who did not have time to buy a token at a discount, we suggest you participate in the ICO, which begins on May 1, 2018 and lasts until June 1, 2018, become a member of the Fobscoin project and earn with one of the safest and largest projects in Russia.
