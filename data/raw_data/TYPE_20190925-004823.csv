Typerium plans to change that, forever.  We're building a decentralised content-creation platform, social media network, and marketplace, that's geared towards the more than 2.4 billion content consumers worldwide.  https://i.imgur.com/jbL43V9.jpg   Why is Typerium needed?  Typerium is needed to protect the intellectual property of content creators, to facilitate a cost-effective and global creative currency, and to create a thriving decentralised marketplace for buying and selling digital content.  https://i.imgur.com/ooKXyh8.png    Core Team  The Typerium team is made up of many talented and highly skilled individuals. We are constantly looking to expand our team, so please get it touch if you are interested in joining. Here is a look at some of our core team members, advisors, and independent consultants.  https://i.imgur.com/xpLmz3n.jpg    Built for success  Typerium is a new business, but business certainly isn’t new to our core team. Here’s a breakdown of the key attributes some our core team  bring to Typerium.  Alexander Haigh (CEO) Alex is the founder of the UK’s leading online font technology development and licensing business, HypeForType. Alex has single-handedly built a business that has provided more than 35,000 fonts to 13.8 million users in 165 countries. HypeForType has developed technologies that bring type to screen, consumer products, user interfaces and provide substantial commercial value for the world’s leading brands including Adidas, Apple, Disney, Google, Loreal, Nestle, Nickelodeon, Nike, Selfridges, Sky TV, Starbucks, Sony and Vogue.   Shahpour Abbasvand (VP Design & Development) Previously appointed as Creative Director at the globally admired agency AKQA, Shahpour is an innovative team leader who specialises in creative and technical application development. Before leaving AKQA to pursue other opportunities, Shahpour worked with the Philips product and software development teams to help drive their digital transformation. During this time, four new products were launched and time-to-market was shortened, which successfully redefined the company’s market position by adding $500 million to their brand value.   Ali Kurtze (Blockchain Team Leader) Ali is a software development expert who has successfully driven a team of 27 developers to deliver the highest quality software products for branding. These include projects for Breaking Bad, Nissan, and Sony. With a wide range of experience, Ali has built, recruited and structured large development teams. He also has a solid background in team leadership, so Ali will be the driving force for all blockchain-related development on the TYPE Protocol.   The world’s leading brands rely on us  We have established key relationships in our existing businesses, which have enabled us to design, license and develop for some of the world’s leading brands.   https://i.imgur.com/Q7Nz3OZ.png   Roadmap  Roadmap dates may be anticipated and subject to change, given the nature of software development.   https://i.imgur.com/sw0hRiu.jpg   Website | Whitepaper | Bounty | Teaser Video | Explainer Video  https://i.imgur.com/JYF9G6p.png https://i.imgur.com/RopDEIf.png https://i.imgur.com/1Ehtfqb.png https://i.imgur.com/iJUsS9u.png https://i.imgur.com/FSriRxI.png  © Copyright Typerium.
