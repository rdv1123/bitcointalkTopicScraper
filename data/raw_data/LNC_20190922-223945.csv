Origin believes that monopolistic middlemen have no place in peer-to-peer marketplaces. Origin wants to build open, fair, and censorship resistant technologies that allow people to do business with whomever they want without the permission of corporate rulers. Blockchain technology will have a profound impact on the global economy from how companies are started to how markets are organized.  The global Origin community of engineers are collaborating on the creation of a JavaScript library and a smart contract library. Origin does all of this open source development in public. Please join their Discord if you want to be part of these efforts. The ultimate goal of Origin is to empower anyone to easily build marketplace DApps. Origin has a fully decentralized live demo up on testnet as a proof of concept and a starting point for others to build on.  Over thirty projects have committed to building on the Origin platform.  We are pleased to announce that Blocklancer will be building the freelancing marketplace DApp on Origin Protocol. Blocklancer is a so called Distributed Autonomous Job Marketplace (DAJ) on the blockchain. Blocklancer is changing the way freelancing works for both the freelancer and the customer, concentrating on building a trustworthy platform all stakeholders can rely on. This is done by minimizing fees and introducing a decentralized tribunal system to guarantee every dispute resolution case is settled fairly. We are happy to be a part of the Origin protocol ecosystem.  The Blocklancer team has been aware of Origin for a while now. Origin already has a working demo and is building strong partnerships with many interesting blockchain projects that have a very high potential. We are happy to be a part of the Origin family and together we can build better decentralized products and can share important knowledge.  Stay tuned for more news from Blocklancer!",False

The soft cap has already been reached 6 times over by now, so even if the hard cap isn't reached the project will go off as planned. The remaining unsold tokens will be burnt.  From an investor's perspective not selling out isn't a negative thing as long as enough funds were raised to launch the project properly and to reach its full potential, as a lower market cap implies a greater upside potential for early token buyers. On the other hand, more funds mean slightly less potential gains but at a possibly much faster rate.  Hope this answered your question.    And also as regards directly the question of the price of the token and the views of the developers themselves:  Quote As far as price predictions go, in the short term these are completely and utterly impossible.  In the long term (several years) Blocklancer could reach a market cap similar to that of currently existing sites as well as exceeding them due to their superior platform. Then there's also the massive growth in the Freelancing market that is to be expected in the coming years. A market cap in the $100m to $1b range would be small, which would equate to a token value of something along the lines of 70 cents and $7, or a 10 to 100 increase as a low end estimate.   I hope that these words will reassure those who are now worried or nervous. Calm down.  In any case, the money is already invested, the tasks are fulfilled .... We can only wait - it's now for the experts in their field   I hope my words were useful to you ",False

Welcome to the campaign.  Quote from: boty on February 27, 2018, 05:10:39 PM Hello bounty hunter,, There's something I want to ask you a bit about this bounty payment does anyone know the calculation of payments related to the stake? Every category has a total amount of shares. Your shares divided by the total amount of category shares will determine your percentage of the respective category. The category value is a function of the percentage listed in the bounty portal and the total amount of Ethereum raised.  If there's 1000 shares in a given category and you have 100 of those shares, you will get 10% of that category. If the category is worth 26% of the bounty pool it means that you'll get 2.6% of the bounty pool. The bounty pool is 2% of the total amount raised during the ICO.",False

The thread that you've linked was posted by a sock puppet created by said scammers.  If you check his post history and timeline you'll find that the account was created solely as an attempt at defamation as a retort of me exposing all the red flags regarding CL in their ANN. They falsely assumed that I was a part of the Blocklancer team, while I just exposed a scam like I'd usually would (refer to my post history to see that I regularly expose scams of different types when I come across them) and hence tried to attack this team as a result.  If you actually take apart the thread that he posted you should quickly see that it's a bunch of pointless accusations that are fully devoid of an understanding of corporate reality. Not to mention that resources are allocated within market standards. If the reasoning that this scammer provided was true that would turn not just every single ICO, but also every single traditional venture into a scam. And the facts are clearly aligned against his case.    Edit: I recommend reading the Whitepaper and the Yellowpaper (rigorous technical paper) if you're still in doubt. Both of which are far beyond market standards. And I don't mean from a writing perspective (the English isn't flawless), but from a content perspective.

Thank you for the kind words, I'm sure the team at Blocklancer will be happy to read them.  As for your question. There was a soft cap and a hard cap for the ICO. The soft cap indicated the minimal amount of funds needed to run this project. The hard cap is the maximum and reaching it would make things a lot easier (more aggressive marketing for example).  The soft cap has already been reached 6 times over by now, so even if the hard cap isn't reached the project will go off as planned. The remaining unsold tokens will be burnt.  From an investor's perspective not selling out isn't a negative thing as long as enough funds were raised to launch the project properly and to reach its full potential, as a lower market cap implies a greater upside potential for early token buyers. On the other hand, more funds mean slightly less potential gains but at a possibly much faster rate.  Hope this answered your question.

If you are on the fence about contributing, I urge you to read Blocklancer's Whitepaper & business plan, then compare this product to any crypto with a 500m + market cap. I know which token I would rather hold. Once this token hits exchanges and the platform gains adoption, this ICO price will feel like a steal.

Will these ever be released, or is the total supply really 155 million coins?  It would make the different between a 66 million dollar crowd sale and a 10 million dollar crows sale.

Will it be possible to ""contract/hire"" third parties to participate in the THT on your behalf without compromising token security? I'd imagine that very large holders would be quite interested in being able to contract others to work on the THT for them while paying them a share. Simultaneously people with no tokens would be able to earn some money on the THT without holding large quantities of tokens themselves.  This is something that could potentially attract more investors, while at the same time increasing the amount of voters on the THT to ensure fairly settled disputes.

Or at least I was until I saw your calculations. If Ethereum doesn't upgrade its transaction throughput significantly, Blocklancer could actually end up congesting it on its own. With the Freelancer market growing at a rapid pace filling up 14400 jobs a day doesn't seem like a too outlandish target, especially if campaign managers ended up throwing their bounties onto Blocklancer to ensure that the people that join their bounty campaigns are of a high calibre. Fortunately that's still a few years into the future though, so by then ERC20 should be much more efficient than it is right now.  With fees being distributed to the voters, would that (in analogy) make the voters similar to miners on traditional PoW blockchains?

We decided to only use Ether for paying because of the wide acceptance of Ether and the simplicity to hold and obtain it. This way we further encourage the wide acceptance of Blocklancer. - They don't offer any utility (Tokenholder Tribunal) for their Token and neither any improvements compared to current freelancing platforms for the average user rather difficulties (their token). - Not very detailed whitepaper because the first four and the last six pages of their 20 page whitepaper are just filler and the rest doesn't contains any technical information.

Also, since Ethereum had some major issues with that crypto kitty game (which only added 7~8 tx/sec to the blockchain), do you intend to implement further currencies for paying in the future if the slow transcations become an issue? The new Waves platform already supports over 100 tx/sec and can go up to ~1000 tx/sec, which is quite a leap from what Ethereum offers right now.

If we add 1 transaction per second to the Ethereum Blockchain we generate 86400 transactions (60*60*24) per day. On current freelancing platforms every job has at max ~3 bids which results in 6 transactions per job (1x creation, 3x bid, 1x accepting, 1x payout). If we divide the transactions per day (86400) by the amount of transactions per job we get the result of 14400 jobs per day. As comparison Freelancer.com currently handles ~8600 jobs per day. This proves very well that we don't need that many transactions as for example a decentralized exchange  .  All fees are distributed to the voter in the Tokenholder Tribunal to encourage voting on the platform.  Regarding Waves, it is currently no solution because they don't support smart contracts as of now but I will keep an eye on them. Other currencies are no problem to implement especially Ethereum Tokens.  The new whitepaper is already released you can find it here.

A holder of the Lancer Token benefits from the Blocklancer platform in two ways.  - If you hold more than 10,000 Lancer Token you get access to premium features on the Blocklancer platform. After holding more than 10,000 Lancer Tokens for a period of at least 1 month your account will be automatically upgraded to a premium account.  - If you hold Lancer Tokens, you are allowed to participate in the Tokenholder Tribunal. For participating in the Tokenholder Tribunal in an honest and informed way you will be rewarded by a share of the platform fees. The benefits of the premium account and the participation in the Tokenholder Tribunal will be delineated in the following sections.  Premium Accounts  Access to premium accounts is restricted to Tokenholders. Only Tokenholders, who hold more than 10,000 Lancer Tokens, for a period longer than 1 month get access to premium features of the platform. This way we incentivize people, who are interested in the long-term success of Blocklancer. People, who are holding Lancer Tokens purely for speculative reasons and short periods of time, will not be able to use premium features. With the success of the Blocklancer platform the demand for Lancer Tokens will increase, on the other hand the supply for Lancer Tokens will decrease, because premium users will not sell their Tokens, because they would lose access to the premium features.  The premium account includes features such as: - Getting access to detailed profile statistics. Know, who viewed your profile and how you can optimize your profile appearance. - Only allow the best rated freelancers to apply for your jobs. Your job offers will be predominantly visible to the best freelancers on the platform. Freelancers with no rating or bad rating will not be allowed to apply for your jobs. - Your job offers will be higher ranked by our search engine. - Your application for a job offer will be ranked above non-premium applicants. - Get early access to new features.  Best regards, The Blocklancer Team",False

I somehow overlooked you question at first glance.  The premium account price isn't planned to be dynamic because we believe that supporters from the first hour should be rewarded in the long run. If you think about it everyone has the chance to buy the tokens at the same price . But I have to admit some feature should never be unbuyable expensive. An option here would be to create another cheaper premium option (with far less features) but instead of buying tokens they need to pay a small fee into the fee pool which later gets paid out to the Token Holder and thus we are able to create a win-win situation.

We decided to only allow 10 bids to reduce the amount of bids in total. If you think about it the chances of getting a job are always the same no matter the amount of bids. The only thing that changes is that there is more/less competition on every job. Another important fact of the 10 bids is that a freelancer shouldn't just mass bid on every job. Otherwise he could just bid on all jobs and cancel all he doesn't likes that much and thus only causes the clients trouble.  If a Tokenholder owns more than zero vote shares (see whitepaper) he is able to report a job offer. After this as with a normal dispute a single random vote group (see whitepaper) of the Token Holder decides about the job offer. If they come to the conclusion that the job is indeed spam it gets delisted.  To tackle identity theft we plan to integrate services such as uPort and similar services: uPort allows end-users to own and control their personal identity, reputation, data, and digital assets, securely and selectively disclose their data to counterparties, access digital services without using passwords; digitally sign claims, transactions, and documents, control and send value on a Blockchain, interact with decentralized applications and smart contracts, and encrypt messages and data.

(Currently in the alpha 10 bids per day) -   Blocklancer only uses the Blockchain as needed and thus we are able to prevent jobs from being listed.

But from another point of view it keeps Blocklancer visible. And more attention means a more successful ICO for which pointless bounty questions would be a cheap price to pay. I can't really see any serious investors losing interest because of ""spammers"" in a naturally spammy forum either.   Quote from: Blocklancer on November 09, 2017, 10:15:07 PM Quote from: BTCMILLIONAIRE on November 09, 2017, 08:39:39 PM That's not what freelancing websites are normally used for.  But that is indeed a very nice idea that Blocklancer might want to consider expanding into! Having a branch that is specifically used to connect people with tutors for different subjects would be quite nice.   Not only would it increase the value of the token, but it would also give teachers, tutors and students a new platform to connect.  I'm sure the same problems that freelancers face today are faced by tutors as well. And since that technically does fall under the ""freelancing"" category it would be silly not to take advantage of that market and add it to the Blocklancer platform!  Hopefully the team will look into this. Hi, That's a wonderful idea. We already consider to add a fiverr like job offering system into Blocklancer as well. With that said it's not that hard to set it up for tutors as well. We just need to check out how that fits into Blocklancer (and how much demand there is).  We are currently working on a few extensions for blocklancer to offer everything needed to allow jobs to be paid hourly. But more to that in the next dev update.  Best regards, The Blocklancer Team Unless I'm missing something, setting up a section for tutors should be as simple as ""copy/pasting"" what is already there and specifically promoting that branch of the platform as well. I keep seeing tons of flyers and job offers for tutors around campus all the time, so I would imagine that the demand would be quite large and that it would merely be a question of raising awareness (which may or may not be difficult/resource intensive).

I had a hunch that that's what most disputes would end up being like, I just tend to like to think about the fringe cases before they occur. Very interesting to see some actual numbers about the dispute cases though!  What would the higher instance tribunals look like?   Quote from: Blocklancer on November 03, 2017, 05:25:24 AM Quote from: aalavandan on November 02, 2017, 04:09:30 PM those freelancers working through your platform, will they get paid in your tokens only? Hi, Thanks for the question. On the Blocklancer platform freelancer are paid in Ether. We also plan to accept Tether(USDT) to reduce the risk of price fluctuations of Ether. Everything else would be just too big of a hassle for everyone involved. Many people already own Ether why should we use something else?  The biggest advantage of the Lancer Token is that the Token Holder receive 100% of the fees. On top of that the Token Holder are allowed to vote on disputes.  Best regards, The Blocklancer Team Have you heard anything about the US regulations that end up treating ""profit sharing schemes"" as ""securities"" and thus deeming them illegal, making them unlistable on some of the larger exchanges (in the US)?  And does this concern Blocklancer in any way or would the platform simply operate under a legislature where this problem does not occur in the first place?",False

Important to note here is that not every dispute is viewable(voteable) by every token holder. This insures that in the very unlikely case that: Friend A isn't definitely able to vote for Friend B. Which is very unlikely alone due to the fact that friend A would lose LNC but this also solves unrational decisions by token holders. A higher instance tribunal could be that more groups of token holders are allowed to vote on it. Another option is that only the trustworthiest token holder are allowed to vote on a higher instance dispute.  Regarding the profit sharing. Blocklancer has the huge advantage that we give token holder a share for voting on disputes. We are in contact with lawyers because of this because we believe it is very important for everyone involved in Blocklancer to be on the save side.  Best regards, The Blocklancer Team",False

So this is good  2. if i am not wronkg t0tal supply is high 1b. So this is bad  3. if I am nt wrong the price if you invest now is around 0.2 or 0.01 usd for one lnc. this is cheap (because supply very big OK)  4. if you spend 2-3 hours each day reading about cryptos you more or less can expect a price for a project which you are interested in. Yes, you can be wrong, but I think you can give a real answer and no answe as you did it.  5. For example BOScoin (new project now on exchanges), the price now is about 0.80 usd.  total supply 500.000.000 , a project very original too.  and the ico price was around 0.04 usd.   If you are a real  investor I can not believe that you didnt think about a real price that you think is possible for one year for the coin you chose...   I think that you like investor should think about this and I think you should have your opinion. If not what are you doing here? i have my opinion too. Maybe I am wrong: but do you think that is it possible a initial price on exchanges around  0.40 usd?  and a price in year around 1 usd? whats your opinion about prices?",False

If there was 1000 times more Bitcoins available but you could mine them 1000 times faster, the price would simply be smaller by a factor of 1000, but you'd have 1000 times more Bitcoin, so ultimately it's not going to be any different from now. So no, a supply of 1 Billion is not ""bad"". If you think so you don't understand crypto (or assets in general) and should take some time off to study financial markets and instruments instead of wasting time on this forum.  As far as a real price is concerned. I have certainly made some calculations for bad and good scenarios, but why should I tell you the prices? So you can outbuy me on the market even though you didn't do any research yourself?  Anyways, start by analyzing the market that the project seeks to address. In this case Freelancing. There is a lot of data about how big this market is. Then assume that Blocklancer gets a certain share of this market, make up your own mind about what you believe is realistic by researching available data for other freelancing websites. Then take that number and calculate it against the amount of fees that gets processed by the platform. Divide it by the number of tokens, and voila. You've got an estimate. This works for every project, takes more time and effort than reading this forum, but is also vastly more accurate and will allow you to outplay all the clueless people on the internet.  Good luck.",False

Basically this is just a bad copycat of Blocklancer, which popped up from nowhere. I read their (not very detailed) whitepaper and there are some major differences:      They are not distributing the fees among the tokenholders     The fees are paid in their own token, which means that their platform cannot be used without their token     They have nothing about the platform online: no code, no demo, nothing.     They write that they will release the platform right after the ICO, which is suspicious (Why not before? We release before the ICO and already released a Demo before the pre-sale)     The whitepaper is not very technical and is not describing how they will solve anything in detail (the Whitepaper of Blocklancer is very technical and detailed)     They have no businessplan     They have no community(13 follower on Twitter!), I was also not able to find a BitcoinTalk ANN from them, they have no slack/discord/Rocket.Chat     They are not showing how much money was already invested  Coinlancer seems scammy but everyone should make his own due diligence.

They write that they will release the platform right after the ICO, which is suspicious (Why not before? We release before the ICO and already released a Demo before the pre-sale) The whitepaper is not very technical and is not describing how they will solve anything in detail (the Whitepaper of Blocklancer is very technical and detailed) They have no businessplan They have no community(13 follower on Twitter!), I was also not able to find a BitcoinTalk ANN from them, they have no slack/discord/Rocket.Chat They are not showing how much money was already invested  Coinlancer seems scammy but please make your own due diligence!

Blocklancer is a so called Distributed Autonomous Job Market (DAJ) on the Ethereum platform, our vision of a completely self-regulatory platform for finding jobs and getting projects done. It will change the way freelancing works, both for customers and freelancers, and it will lift the reliability of freelancing to new heights.  Find jobs Find jobs easily even without knowledge of what the blockchain is. You can search for jobs on our job market platform or build your reputation as a freelancer and get contacted directly by customers requesting your expertise. Simplicity is a core principle of this platform.  Get jobs done In need of getting a job done? No problem! Simply create a job offer at our platform and wait for freelancers to take you up on your offer or contact trustworthy freelancers directly. It's as easy as it gets!   BLOCKLANCER SOLVES ALL PROBLEMS OF CURRENT FREELANCER PLATFORMS With this project we want to tackle several issues that are currently prevalent in the freelancing world, including but not reserved to: fake reviews, getting the payment for your work reliably and the uncontrollable influence of a central authority figure.  Guaranteed Payment On Blocklancer you only have to pay if you are 100 % satisfied with the work or if certain milestones are reached. And in case of a dispute the token holders will decide. Never again will you encounter unilateral decisions by a biased authority and an unfair money loss.  Fair and Automated Settling of Disputes Never depend on a single authority to settle your disputes again. With our token holder tribunal (THT) the decision lies in the hands of thousands of token holders, guaranteeing a fair decision.  Low Fees Our fees are only 3 % per job, several times lower than on other freelancing websites. Freelancing will finally be a lucrative way of earning money - and reliable as well.  No Censorship Because of the blockchain, your job offers can't be deleted under any circumstances. Political Correctness and personal feelings play no role anymore, because the blockchain is incorruptible.    THE LANCER TOKEN The Tokens represent the share you have in our project. The Tokens are therefore comparable to shares in a company, where you receive a certain percentage of the companies revenue.  Token holders earn Fees 100 % of the fees earned from jobs on our platform will be distributed among the token holders.  Token holders keep the System running The token holders will be given a vote in our token holder tribunal, settling disputes between customers and freelancers.

BitJob is quite different, because they describe themselves as ""P2P Students Marketplace for Online short-term Jobs"". In Blocklancer, it is not just about students and short-term jobs. We are a platform for ALL freelancers and clients and we employ methods (milestones) to also allow big-jobs on the blockchain.  StorMarket on the other side describes themselves as ""micro-task marketplace economy"".

Therefore we decided to cancel the running ICO. We thank all early investors and all of them get refunded after the 5. September. If somebody doesn't know, how to get refunded, please do not hesitate to contact us via e-mail.  Blocklancer is a great and unique project, but the current situation is very difficult. We did an in-depth analysis, why it was not possible for us to reach the goal. The key point is that we had not enough money for advertising and therefore our exposure in media was not broad enough. Our social media presence is very high, but we were not able to reach out to the masses. Another problem is that the market situation is currently very problematic. Many investors are on holidays and many other people are still shocked by the Multi-sig hack and the CoinDash disaster.  We believe in the idea of a distributed freelancing platform and we have a great plan to continue.   In September or October, we will launch a pre-ICO (with max cap 500 ETH), where everybody has the possibility to get Lancer Tokens for the rate 1ETH : 20,000 LNC. Everybody who invested in the current ICO will get LNC for the rate 1ETH : 25,000 LNC. This way we want to incentivize everyone, who is a loyal Blocklancer supporter. Moreover we are creating a demo platform and every investor in the pre-sale will have the possibility to become an early-tester of the platform. The bounty campaign will be extended until the pre-sale ends and the participants will get 2% of the raised money from the pre-sale.  The money raised from the pre-sale will be invested in advertising for the actual ICO, which is planned in winter (maybe December or January).   We will also release an official Slack and Telegram channel very soon. We still think that the community is the most precious asset and we are always very happy to get constructive feedback from all of you.  We think that with this plan we can reach our goal to revolutionize the freelancing market and we are highly motivated to work on this project all day!   Kind regards The Blocklancer Team",False

Many investors are on holidays and many people are still shocked by the CoinDash hack (All our supporters know that this could never happen to us ).  After the ICO (in September), we will come back with another crowdsale (maybe a uncapped pre-sale). With a demo, the evidence that our ICOs are very secure and the support of our community, we will then definetely attract much more investors. And with the money from this crowdsale we can advertise on much bigger platforms like forbes and coinmarketcap to spread our vision of Blocklancer to big investors. We are very positive that Blocklancer will be THE first big platform on the Blockchain, that is really useable for many people all over the world.

We also think that not having a pre-ICO is a good thing for the investors. Selling tokens for dump prices can have enormous negative side-effects. For example one negative side effect of pre-ICOs is how early investors often sell at ICO prices once a token hits an exchange. In doing so, they still make an enormous profit and cripple the token’s price in the process. And there are also often transparency problems involved in pre-ICOs. So, we decided to not have a pre-ICO, because in the long term this is the best – for our token and for the investors.  Best regards, The Blocklancer Team",False

Blocklancer is totally transparent. Our team is known, whitepaper is published, code published and even a business plan is published (can you tell me any other ICO with a business plan, because I don't know any). But as you may know, we are always here to answer all of your questions as detailed as possible. We absolutely understand that nowadays many users are very skeptic about ICOs. We are very serious here at BLOCKLANCER and we are doing our best to make this project a success for everyone (freelancers, client, bounty participants, investors and tokenholders). We are also super transparent: You can find all the information on our webpage or in the whitepaper. We even released our smart-contracts on git-hub. I think everybody, who seriously investigated about BLOCKLANCER or joined our bounty campaign, sees that there are many people putting their hearts and souls into this project and it is absolutely unfair to discredit these hard-working people without having any factual argument. There is lot of evidence out there that proofs that the Blocklancer Team is absolutely competent and hard working. If you investigate in other projects, you basically find nothing (sometimes even no whitepaper), except a big team with many (many) advisors. And regarding your concerns of young accounts you can also check here (nobody fakes such a account) to see that definitely not all accounts are young. Moreover it is not super-usual all over the world to have ""high-leveled"" linkedIn accounts. Here in Austria we have lots of professionals without having a linkedIn accounts. By the way, your BitcoinTalk account is also not a Legendary And an ICO should not be about investing in some twitter-accounts. It is about investing in new concepts and businesses with potential for the future. But if your investment strategy suggests to just invest in some old guys, who did 100 projects before, you will definitely miss a big chance (consider: you'd have also missed Google, Facebook, Twitter, paypal, Amazon, an much more). Having a young and highly motivated team is a big asset.  BLOCKLANCER is not a big show around the founders and advisors. BLOCKLANCER is also not the hundredth financial platform that makes everybody ""rich"" within seconds. BLOCKLANCER tries to solve a real-problem for many people. Many people have no access to the job market or are frustrated by the current freelancing platforms. BLOCKLANCER integrates many people into the job market and moreover Blocklancer improves freelancing by far. If you are interested, how Blocklancer works internally you can find everything in the whitepaper or if you are a coder you can even have a look on the smart contracts.  There are many projects out there, which are just talk and no action, but BLOCKLANCER is different. From the first day on we launched our homepage with a detailed technical description of the inner workings and we are nearly permanently on this forum, facebook, etc. to answer all your questions. We are also writing blog posts, create videos, etc. to bring our vision to the people.  If somebody thinks that Blocklancer is not legit, he must think that all ICOs are scam, because as mentioned above, Blocklancer offers far more than many other ICOs. The whole team loves to work on this project and we all believe in our idea of revolutionizing the job market. We know that it is not possible to convince everybody, but we are honored by everybody who believes in us and our project. We are very thankful for everybody, who supported us up to know and we are sure that with the help of our awesome community, Blocklancer will be definitely a huge success.

The contracts in the repository are meant to be a proof-of-concept. It demonstrates the feasibility of the whole Blocklancer platform. It already solves many issues involved in the freelancing process, including but not limited to: •   refusals of paying the agreed-on amount of money for a project, •   unfair decisions •   the uncontrollable influence of a central authority figure  Token Holder Tribunal The current implementation of the Token Holder Tribunal already includes major improvements compared to the voting system in current tokens (e.g. Augur). Another undesirable problem of the democratic implementations presented so far is definitely not technical, but social. During the voting period, running tallies are public. This leads to undesirable consequences such as bandwagoning and groupthink. Thus a successful voting system has to hide the outcome of the vote until everyone made their vote. In the Blocklancer platform everyone submits his vote sealed and has to unseal it after everyone submitted his vote and thus hides the result from the crowd. With this implementation, Blocklancer is really able to harness the wisdom of the unbiased crowd. In addition, Blocklancer doesn’t locks transfers of funds whilst a vote is active as other tokens do. Transfers of Tokens are always possible and at the same time we are able to tackle double votes.  Employment Contracts All Employment contracts are stored in a contract holder. With this implementation we are able to ensure the highest amount of expandability by adding the ability to support many different sorts of contracts. Another advantage is expandability and modularity by providing the option to seamlessly replace contracts of the system.  Migration to a new Contract The Blocklancer contract is designed to be able to migrate to a new contract in the case another standard (ERC20) should be established and thus makes Blocklancer future proof. With this concept Blocklancer is able to change every aspect of the platform at any given time just by asking the token holder to approve the change. You can find the source code on Github.

Hi, thanks for your interest, The SEC ruled that some ICOs are selling securitys and therefore must be registered. The Blocklancer Token has far more to offer than a speculative value of a security for an investor. When you hold our Token you help in building and running a platform for Freelancers and Clients to be happy beeing around. The Blocklancer Token (Lancer LNC) is far more than just a simple token with no value. With Blocklancer you're involved in decision making and thus it's a utility token which isn't regulated. Therefor its absolutely no problem to get listed on exchanges. If it would be all Token/Coins (even Bitcoin) wouldn't be allowed to be traded.  Moreover the statement of the SEC was very specific to the DAO. By holding the DAO Token, tokenholders passively benefited from the investments of Slock.it (the company behind the DAO). This means that the DAO Token had absolutely no utility. It was just an investment in a company. The DAO Token was not powering a platform or anything else, therefore it is not a utility token and it is legit to see it as a security.  The Lancer token by all means is a utility token. The purpose of the LNC is to power a new generation of freelancing platforms. The Lancer token is absolutely not compareable with the DAO tokens. You can compare our LNC tokens to Augurs REP, which is also definitely not a security.  Many exchanges already said that they are just listing utility tokens and REP is listed on all of them, so there is absolutely no reason to think that LNC will not be listed on exchanges.  Best reagrds, The Blocklancer Team",False

With for example the Token Holder Tribunal (THT), decision making by the community, and many more. With that we really use the Blockchain as an improvement to the existing systems. This ensures trust between freelancers and clients.  BitJob is quite different, because they describe themselves as ""P2P Students Marketplace for Online short-term Jobs"". In Blocklancer, it is not just about students and short-term jobs. We are a platform for ALL freelancers and clients and we employ methods (milestones) to also allow big-jobs on the blockchain.   StorMarket on the other side describes themselves as ""micro-task marketplace economy"". And at the moment it is totally unclear what they are doing at all, because right now there is no technical description of their platform available and also no whitepaper (on their website they state that the whitepaper is coming soon for about 3 weeks!).

StorMarket on the other side describes themselves as ""micro-task marketplace economy"".

The Blocklancer Token has far more to offer than a speculative value of a security for an investor. When you hold our Token you help in building and running a platform for Freelancers and Clients to be happy beeing around. The Blocklancer Token (Lancer LNC) is far more than just a simple token with no value. With Blocklancer you're involved in decision making and thus it's a utility token which isn't regulated. Therefor its absolutely no problem to get listed on exchanges. If it would be all Token/Coins (even Bitcoin) wouldn't be allowed to be traded.  Moreover the statement of the SEC was very specific to the DAO. By holding the DAO Token, tokenholders passively benefited from the investments of Slock.it (the company behind the DAO). This means that the DAO Token had absolutely no utility. It was just an investment in a company. The DAO Token was not powering a platform or anything else, therefore it is not a utility token and it is legit to see it as a security.  The Lancer token by all means is a utility token. The purpose of the LNC is to power a new generation of freelancing platforms. The Lancer token is absolutely not compareable with the DAO tokens. You can compare our LNC tokens to Augurs REP, which is also definitely not a security.  Many exchanges already said that they are just listing utility tokens and REP is listed on all of them, so there is absolutely no reason to think that LNC will not be listed on exchanges.

Advantages of Blocklancer  Guaranteed Payment On Blocklancer you only have to pay if you are 100 % satisfied with the work or if certain milestones are reached. And in case of a dispute the token holders will decide. Never again will you encounter unilateral decisions by a biased authority and an unfair money loss.  Fair and Automated Settling of Disputes Never depend on a single authority to settle your disputes again. With our token holder tribunal (THT) the decision lies in the hands of thousands of token holders, guaranteeing a fair decision.  Low Fees Our fees are only 3 % per job, several times lower than on other freelancing websites. Freelancing will finally be a lucrative way of earning money - and reliable as well.  No Censorship Because of the blockchain, your job offers can't be deleted under any circumstances. Political Correctness and personal feelings play no role anymore, because the blockchain is incorruptible.",False

It seems that if he isn't satisfied, it directly goes to the token holder tribunal. What if the client do agree that his work isn't sufficient ? What the point of going to the tokens holders tribunal then ? Can't the client and the freelancer think of a friendly resolution of the matter, with, for example, a reduced salary. This lead us to my second inquiries. The token holder tribunal seems too binary to me. Either it decides to give all the funds to the client, either to the freelancer. Are you planning to improve this system so that the client would only have to pay a given percent of the salary fixed at the start ? While your platform seems to be viable for $200 jobs, I'm not sure how good it would be for a $10k one.",False

Of course the THT is just activated, if there is a dispute between the client and the freelancer. This is the scenario, where traditional freelancing platforms are failing. If there is no dispute between client and freelancer then there is nothing to decide for the THT.  Ad Question 2.) We discussed that problem quite extensively in our team. We think that you have to consider 2 main things here:  (1) What is satisfaction We came up with the idea that the satisfaction of the client is a variable and this variable can have certain characteristics. For example the satisfaction can be continous and bounded(0-100), or binary(true/false). If the variable is continous and bounded the client can be 100% satisfied, 0% satisfied or 2.5% satisfied and  every number in between is possible. If the variable is binary/boolean then the client is satisfied or is not satisfied.  If you look at a real world example to exemplify that. Imagine that a client wants a carpenter to create a chair for him. If the carpenter comes up  with a nice chair and the client likes it, the client will pay the carpenter for the chair.  This means the client was 100% satisfied. But what happens if the  carpenter creates a chair with 3 legs. The satisfaction of the client will not  be between 100% and 0%.  It will just be 0%. And also a chair with 2 legs, 1 leg or 0 legs will be not satisfieable at all. This should show that satisfaction is not really a continuos function. In most real-world examples satisfaction will boil down to being satisfied or not.  (2) When will the client benefit from the THT If we design the model in a way that it is possible that the client has to pay just a fraction of the price, it will become extremely attractive for the client to  call the THT every time, because the possibility is very high that the THT decides that he has to  pay less than the predefined price. Then the fees for calling the THT are much smaller than the savings from paying less.  Regarding your concerns for larger projects: For larger projects the milestone system is build in. This means that the client can split up a big project into separateable chunks of work (milestones or workpackages). Then the freelancer is paid for each workpackage separately. And the THT can decide on the milestones, if they are fullfilled or not. This also has the positive effect that the big project is better structured for the freelancer and the client and the freelancer is not at risk of getting no money at all for a big project. This is also connected to question 2 of course.  I hope that it is now a bit clearer for you  Kind regards The Blocklancer team",False

Creating a Job  The BPMN model in the Figure depicts the process of offering a job and bidding for the job. It can be seen that at first the client creates a new job. The client attaches a deadline to the newly created job. This means that the client has to select a bid before the deadline is reached. After job offering, freelancers are able to bid for the job. The bid of the freelancers contains the salary the freelancer wants to get paid for this job. When the client selects a freelancer and his bid, the employment contract is created. The employment contract binds the salary of the freelancer, so that payment of the freelancer will be guaranteed.  Process of finishing the work  Figure 2 depicts, that the client gets his ETH back, if the freelancer is not able to finish the job within the deadline.  Process of successful project  Figure 3 shows a successful project. The freelancer was able to finish the job and the client was satisfied with the work. It can be seen that the client is creating a review of the freelancer and the freelancer is able to create a review of the client. It is also possible to bring an unfounded review to the token holder tribunal. At the end of a successful project, the freelancer is able to collect his salary.  Client is not satisfied with work  Figure 4 shows what happens, if the client is not satisfied with the work of the freelancer. The client is then able to initiate a token holder tribunal. The token holders are voting, if the freelancer was able to accomplish the task or not. The token holders look at the job offer and the submitted work of the freelancer, to decide, if the freelancer was able to fulfill the job offer. Decision making is done by majority vote. It is considered that the majority represents the truth. If the majority decides that the contesting of the submitted work was unreasonable, the freelancer is able to withdraw his salary and the trustworthiness score of the client is decreased. If the tribunal decides that contesting was the right thing to do, the client will be allowed to withdraw the frozen ETH. In both cases the Tokens are redistributed among the token holders. Token holders that voted against the majority lose tokens and the lost tokens are redistributed amongst the voters, who voted with the majority.  Best regards, The Blocklancer Team",False

But we don’t want to change the rules we made at the beginning without asking all participants. If we change the rule everyone will receive the additional stakes for the already made posts. What do you think about it? Should we change the rule? How many stakes would be fair? Why should we not change the rule?  I think it will be difficult in practice. Because it is necessary to subjectively rate each post and its importance. It is better to leave a fixed value stakes at 0.5 (0.2 is very small, 0.5 - easier to count).

Thanks for sharing your opinion with us. You're right you have a point there. It was our idea to start a more active discussion about Blocklancer and especially about freelancing over here with the increase of the received token per post. But you're right it could result in spam. 0.5 stakes per post is still a huge increase it's 2.5 times higher than now. Two stakes per post could really be too high But for now let's see what others think. As we said: ""But we don’t want to change the rules we made at the beginning without asking all participants.""

The Token holder will be the investors and bounty participants in our project. How can we make sure the token holders will make a fair decision? Wrong voting is punished with loss of tokens which are distributed among the other voters. This will guarantee that one single authority won’t be able to influence this platform in their favor. A working platform is in the best interest of the token holders because their Token would increase in worth. In wrong voting they would punish themself (reduced Token price).

We absolutely understand that nowadays many users are very skeptic about ICOs. We are very serious here at BLOCKLANCER and we are doing our best to make this project a success for everyone (freelancers, client, bounty participants, investors and tokenholders). We are also super transparent: You can find all the information on our webpage or in the whitepaper. I think everybody, who seriously investigated about BLOCKLANCER or joined our bounty campaign, sees that there are many people putting their hearts and souls into this project and it is absolutely unfair to discredit these hard-working people without having any factual argument. The team works extremely hard and everyday and brings new content to you every day. There are many projects out there, which are just talk and no action, but BLOCKLANCER is different. From the first day on we launched our homepage with a detailed technical description of the inner workings and we are nearly permanently on this forum, facebook, etc. to answer all your questions. We are also writing blog posts to bring our vision to the people.  If somebody thinks that Blocklancer is not legit, he must think that all ICOs are scam. BLOCKLANCER is really unique, it is the first attempt to bring a freelancing platform onto the blockchain. The whole team loves to work on this project and we all believe in our idea of revolutionizing the job-market. We know that it is not possible to convince everybody, but we are honored by everybody who believes in us and our project. Many things are coming in the upcoming weeks and we are looking forward to working together with the community to make BLOCKLANCER a very successful project.

Quote Dear CoinDash contributors,  It is unfortunate for us to announce that we have suffered a hacking attack during our Token Sale event. During the attack $7 Million were stolen by a currently unknown perpetrator. The CoinDash Token Sale secured $6.4 Million from our early contributors and whitelist participants and we are grateful for your support and contribution.  CoinDash is responsible to all of its contributors and will send CDTs reflective of each contribution. Contributors that sent ETH to the fraudulent Ethereum address, which was maliciously placed on our website, and sent ETH to the CoinDash.io official address will receive their CDT tokens accordingly. Transactions sent to any fraudulent address after our website was shut down will not be compensated.  This was a damaging event to both our contributors and our company but it is surely not the end of our project. We are looking into the security breach and will update you all as soon as possible about the findings.  The CoinDash vision, product and team will continue to live on. We will be fast to recover and we will create the future of trading.  Reminder: We are still under attack. Please do not send any ETH to any address, as the Token Sale has been terminated.  More information will be published on our social channels and our website.  -CoinDash Team",False

We are sorry, but we are not having a pre-ICO. We also think that not having a pre-ICO is a good thing for the investors. Selling tokens for dump prices can have enormous negative side-effects. For example one negative side effect of pre-ICOs is how early investors often sell at ICO prices once a token hits an exchange. In doing so, they still make an enormous profit and cripple the token’s price in the process. And there are also often transparency problems involved in pre-ICOs. So, we decided to not have a pre-ICO, because in the long term this is the best - for our token and for the investors.   Regarding your concerns: Unfortunately, we are not able to give you an investment strategy around 1st August, but we hope that you will stay convinced of our project and maybe invest to make it even better. We have the conviction that Blocklancer solves real-world problems and this is what makes projects successful in the end.  Kind regards The Blocklancer Team",False

They don't have such a huge userbase, they are the devs of the Bitmaker app which is a great achievement, but has nothing to do with freelancing. As it stands, they just want to build a freelancing platform that is the same as the current ones and just bring it on the blockchain. I don't know how you feel about it, but we at Blocklancer think it is important to improve on current sites and not just use the blockchain to be 'cool'.  There isn't that many information about them, but as it seems their main points are:  - low fees (the fees (10-40%) they mention aren't even accurate, because there are plenty of freelancing websites which take less than 5%, we think there isn't even a single freelancer involved in this project otherwise they must know -> seems fishy to me). On the other hand, our fees aren't fixed but completely decentralized and controlled by the token holders who also own the complete blocklancer system and are able to adapt to current market situations by increasing and lowering the fees.  - They mention that they are all successful and earned lots of money but somehow they need to launch a super quick ICO without even having a whitepaper or even something to show off. If we had the money they already earned we would definitely make the blocklancer platform without another ICO why can't they, don't they believe in their idea? Seems very fishy!  - They only mention advantages for the freelancer, I as someone who freelanced a lot and talked with many clients, can tell you clients don't have it easy. There are many freelancers that don't make their work properly or don't at all. What do they plan, scare away all clients?  - and the blockchain   We think we made our point clear with the list above, but we would be interested in your opinion. We want to make clear that blocklancer is not only about low fees, it's about a high quality and simple-to-use freelancing platform that is completely decentralized and owned by the token holders (we give 90% of the tokens to the crowd). Freelancer care more about the platform itself and the clients on there, and not so much about the fee.  If the guys from Storm read this, I give you one important advice, freelance before attempting to make such a platform otherwise there will be many sad freelancers that lose a lot of their money!  best regards, The Blocklancer Team",False

This way our token holder tribunal (THT) consists of many users and the risk of collusion and monopolization is nearly zero.

This means that, the more active users there are on the Blocklancer platform, the more you will earn as a token holder. [2] Trading: Like with other tokens, you can trade your LNC.
