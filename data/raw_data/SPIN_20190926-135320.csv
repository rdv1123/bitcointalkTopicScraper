For ERC-20 tokens, we will handle it directly on the Ethereum blockchain through smart contracts. The implementation of non ERC-20 coin bets will be handled by watching incoming bets, passing that data directly to our smart contract which then will involve requesting a random number as we did before, and logging the bet event (with proof and result) to the blockchain for records. Then, our server will distribute the winnings accordingly. As a result, the bet process will be partially off-chain. However, the random number generation and proof remains the same - retaining the advantage of provable fairness in EtherSpin's platform.

Quote from: neuralstar on March 02, 2018, 07:58:33 PM Quote from: karmaho on March 02, 2018, 07:55:16 PM The online gambling industry is very huge, allowing to bet with any cryptocurrency is a very outstanding idea. Good luck!  The Bitcoin and crypto gambling industry is huge. But how many tokens will be released in the sale? Any airdrop programs? Hopefully we can get a good deal on them.    Hi! Our whitepaper details all of the token information available. There will be a good deal for early investors, but we won't heavily discount the tokens since we are serious about the project.  Unlike other ICOs, we are capping supply in our ICO with one round because we're serious about the project and investors. No more tokens will be created or distributed after. A token lockup will also be in place.  The online gambling industry is extremely huge, research says the size of the industry is over 40 billion. I would like to hear your thought about the gambling community, because online gambling needs to attract a lot of user base and provide stability, as the online gambling industry is so humongous, how does EtherSpin stand out in the gambling scene?   Yup, we will be the first to capture the gambling of every cryptocurrency except for non-Bitcoin/Ethereum. There are currently no existing cryptocurrency casinos for most coins, and we will be the first for all of them.",False

First, distribution of dividends on project profits. Investors will regularly get house profits! This is a huge incentive for investors to buy and hold the token. It pays you over time.  Also, we'll be hosting token jackpot prizes for players and investors.  Finally, we'll also be offering gambling of our own token on the exchange, with a 0% house edge. This will incentivize further holding of our token, as it gets the best rate.  EtherSpin's SPIN token will also be listed on exchanges, so it'll have exposure and an easy market to buy from.
