Where people will move around while the process is decentralized hence they pay less and drivers to earn more. The Customer experience will be governed by our AI-powered bot (Cabbi) but Customer support will be available to interfere in case of emergencies.  So, if a customer loses their phone, they'll get it back. Because the driver will hand it over to RedCab office in that operating city/country after the customer reports the lost phone through the app/dApp. (The driver will not risk running with the phone and get their identity blacklisted)  We suggest reading our WhitePaper if you haven't yet.

It is interesting because it decentralizes the transport solution for individuals using Blockchain Technology, and also saves billions of dollars from the transport commission. The RedCab LLC business model guarantees a 20 percent increase in driver revenue with a clear strategy to increase network dominance in order to increase demand that will allow the average RedCab LLC driver in the city to complete more trips within a certain hour and, as a result, reduce the user's costs, and also repeat the process cycle.

I came across Redcab and i was very interested in buying tokens. After a lot of research it is safe to say that their redc tokens will go to the moon. Here is my conclusion They already have operations now.  Redcab will expand to many countries very quickly in the next 2 years as per their roadmap.  The customer base will grow because they offer a cheaper solution to them compared to Uber, Grab etc As customer base increase, the number of trips will increase, and the number of daily transactions will increase.  REDC will be used to dailly transactions in the dApp. Every time a customer pays for a trip by a credit card/BTC/ETH...etc, they buy REDC Tokens (market order) in the backend from the connected exchange to make the payment.  This will cause grow daily demand on the token from normal people using the service. Not just crypto people. But everyone moving around. They expand more, get more customers, get more trips, get more transactions, They get more people buying REDC Market order = Token value increase. ALOT!!!!  Hodlers of REDC token will be selling it for profit. ALOT of PROFIT!  I think the idea is super brilliant. And one day people who didn’t buy those REDC tokens will be regretting it the same way they regret buying Ethereum when it was for $0.1   Good luck guys! you have my complete support",False

RedCab's expansion plan within the US is planned in Q4 2020 as mentioned in our roadmap and in Asia 1 year before that. Our expansion strategy relies on gradually reducing the cut percentage taken from the trip until we reach our model of 100% earnings to drivers and the only cost to the consumer is the fare of the trip through decentralizing the whole process by mid-2020. While the main cash cow relies on Geo ads contracts from commercial entities interested in targeting certain segments with specialized and tailored ads to lower their marketing costs and increase the fulfillment of provided ads. The market in Asia and the US is heavily dominated by big funded centralized companies indeed as Uber, Lyft, Cabify, grab, etc. However with our business model, and Proof of Driving integration to motivate drivers to get on the wheel to generate tokens as long as they're driving and accepting trips, we lower our operating costs and Proof of marketing to get our customers promote the app to their network and make tokens as long as their network of users are using the app, we lower our marketing costs. Our competitive advantage increases over time due to the inability of competitors to compete without taking a cut from the trip because their only sources of revenues are based on the high commission they obligate the drivers to pay, and the average cost to consumers after including the surged trips. Over time the RedCab network will eventually grow exponentially based on genuine demand from users because it offers a win-win situation for both parties, and while our costs are indirectly controlled as mentioned above, profits will be driven to the company as a consequence with above average annual ROI to our investors, hence giving us the opportunity to re-invest in R&D, acquisitions and carefully expand further.",False

Our first Beta version of the Mobile App went live in 2017, as part of our on ground market research and gathering feedback. The Mobile App soft launch took place in a small touristic spot by the Red Sea for more on hand operations and to test the car hailing service. We observed a huge potential in the industry and rising demand in metropolitan cities globally with a future expectation for the industry ballooning to reach $285 Billion by 2030. 1 The goal of the RedCab “Token Sale” is to convert our business model into a decentralized ecosystem that allows access to global markets with a transparent approach, reduce expenses of transportation for end users saving more than $60B made through middlemen businesses, and to develop our infrastructure to address the growing international demand on transportation services around the world through developing a powerful scalable tool. RedCab LLC was founded by mid of 2016 to reinvent the peer-to-peer transportation solutions by solving a real problem through understanding the root causes of riders’ and drivers’ actual needs, and deliver an innovative solution governed by customer experience, transparency, and efficiency. RedCab LLC gives the chance for everybody to freelance as integrated service providers working on peer-to-peer scale, while taxi companies operate as an aggregated professional service provider. Our business model is designed to deliver 100% of the benefits to users versus 100% earnings to drivers and taxi companies through decentralizing the whole process. The performance matrix and rewards program for drivers is designed to ensure that every single ride gets the highest quality from a customer experience standpoint, while a psychological factor is subtly implemented to govern the customer satisfaction part, and processes are in place to ensure safety of both parties.",False

This is particularly pronounced in the world market. If preliminary study of the transport industry and the transport business becomes noticeable, that absolutely all firms and enterprises in the field of transport contribute to closer work with people and improve services or provide new ones, but do not influence the solution of traffic problems. RedCab LLC, which has been operating since 2016, has tackled this issue by making a futuristic business model in the transport segment. Its main activity is to attract global innovative solutions through the use of Blockchain technology to the existing market demand with an annual turnover of 230+ billion dollars. The project team studied the problem of the transport industry diligently and for a long time, studying its needs through an evaluation and studying market gaps, setting a priority: on the experience of drivers and their needs. This industry has always been and will be very promising and profitable, and the growing demand in major cities with the expected growth of industry will not only allow, but also increase the turnover by 2030 to 300 billion dollars. At the moment, the company is launching the sale of RedCab tokens to turn its business model from a centralized application into a decentralized ecosystem that will allow access to global coverage and reduce transportation costs for users.

The second is an acceptable price, that is, the most affordable price for a fare with a driver. The third is the creation of one community from different markets with a wide variety of opportunities.

This could create an opportunity for a common payment mechanism that simplifies how consumers pay for the various mobility and mass transit services they use to get around urban areas. Cryptocurrencies leveraging distributed ledgers and loaded onto prepaid transit cards would provide just such a digital payments mechanism that consumers could use to pay for ride-hailing, bus, and subway services, while creating transparency and trust among providers of those services. Consumers could use the cryptocurrency value on their card to pay for multi-modal transportation, enabling them, for instance, to take a trip part way on mass transit and part way on a bike-sharing or ride-hailing platform, and pay for the whole trip with one transaction on one card. All those transactions would then be stored on a decentralized ledger, allowing all of the transportation providers to verify and view those transactions, and giving them valuable data into customers' transportation habits. Although such a decentralized approach would have important benefits for consumers and transportation companies, there are still significant barriers to enabling such cross-service transportation purchases for consumers via cryptocurrencies: cryptocurrencies and the distributed ledger technology that supports them are still in very early phases of their technological development, according to Haggiag. This means that more progress needs to be made before distributed ledger technology can support mass transit systems. For these reason this could be a very innovative project!! Good luck guys",False

Without these ""middle-mens"" the driver will recieve 100% odf their salary while the transpaortation is getting much cheaper for the customer itsself. As i can see the team behind the project as observed the market for 8 years to see the transaformation, so i think they are wll-known in the car-sharing and transportation business. One other interesting aspect is that its not just a car sharing platform but they also have B2B-division including private limousines, taxis and delivery fleet. So they are also getting in direct competition not only with Uber but also the other flagships of the transportation market like UPS, DHL or TNT. This division is the more interesting for me because here the big money is created. Also great to see that this project didn´t only have a whitepaper and vaporware but a working product with RedCap-app which is available for Android and IOS users also.

We will not take a cut from the trips. 100% of the price paid by the rider goes to the driver, and because the whole process is decentralized, the rider pays less, and the driver gets all of the money. Personalized Geo-Ads RedCab LCC main monetization pillar is Geo Ads, where Hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, cafes, clubs, etc. will push offers and promote their products on the Mobile App map depending on an algorithm analyzing historical data for each rider, and showing only what is relevant to capitalize on the fulfillment KPI and drive profitability. In the upcoming new era, people won’t just buy products because they’ve seen a nice ad or because the offered service was portrayed nicely. Marketing is evolving, and at RedCab, we’re aboard that train. Specialized, tailored, and guaranteed to succeed ads. This is what the people will spend their money on in the future. Using technology to recognize the needs based upon analyzing behavior, routes, preferences, and personality preferences. Then offer only what is relevant will result in maximizing the fulfillment rate of such offered products or services, and lower the costs on the business owner. Our strategy also builds an emotional connection between the buyer and the offered product through personalizing the whole experience and engaging our AI powered road assistant in day-to-day interactions to offer only what is relevant when it is relevant, hence increasing the possibility of fulfillment and driving more revenues from consequent purchases. The main idea behind moving our business model into a complete decentralized model, is to give something back to our communities in the way of an affordable, transparent, and useful service that people can use on daily basis. Yet we’re running a company, and we have to generate profits to sustain such a roadmap. The revenue model is based on maintaining our on-ground operations within the cities we currently operate-in, and expand carefully to more coastal cities to guarantee that we are providing our growing network of customers with seamless transportation solution. Revenues will remain to be generated from our current 15% commission scheme on completed trips till we gradually shift our operations from a centralized model to a completely decentralized model. The revenue model gradually ramps down the commission percentage and in parallel ramps up the monetization model by selling 16 targeted geo ads as our network grows, data accumulates and consequently analyzed to tailor our ads according to our customers’ preferences. Shifting our business model will require us to develop an infrastructure capable of sustaining our growth to offer a concrete business model that is bringing revenues and generates profits solely from our marketing stream while moving people. We expect our EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to be within the 25–40% range annually based on our OPEX model, productivity, recurring revenue, niche, and RedCab’s growing team experience. Because Proof of driving cuts the majority of our operational costs, and Proof of marketing eliminates most of the marketing costs, our operating expenses will be lower than our competitors as a consequence, thus reflecting consistent profits in Redcab’s annual P&L statement. Productivity is governed through our network dominance model, while the same model ensures recurring revenues because as the network grows, demand grows and supply matches it. By niche we improve revenues while keeping our costs low through dominating a small market, which in turn translates into lower customer acquisition costs and better consequent business. RedCab’s team will grow as the company grows, and as talented and experienced calibers get aboard, we grow stronger. By gradually ramping down the current revenue stream while in-parallel ramping up our more profitable revenue stream, we ensure sustainability, and future growth of RedCab. Shifting our business model will require us to develop an infrastructure capable of sustaining our growth to offer a concrete business model that is bringing revenues and generates profits solely from our marketing stream while moving people.

This could create an opportunity for a common payment mechanism that simplifies how consumers pay for the various mobility and mass transit services they use to get around urban areas. Cryptocurrencies leveraging distributed ledgers and loaded onto prepaid transit cards would provide just such a digital payments mechanism that consumers could use to pay for ride-hailing, bus, and subway services, while creating transparency and trust among providers of those services. Consumers could use the cryptocurrency value on their card to pay for multi-modal transportation, enabling them, for instance, to take a trip part way on mass transit and part way on a bike-sharing or ride-hailing platform, and pay for the whole trip with one transaction on one card. All those transactions would then be stored on a decentralized ledger, allowing all of the transportation providers to verify and view those transactions, and giving them valuable data into customers' transportation habits. Although such a decentralized approach would have important benefits for consumers and transportation companies, there are still significant barriers to enabling such cross-service transportation purchases for consumers via cryptocurrencies: cryptocurrencies and the distributed ledger technology that supports them are still in very early phases of their technological development, according to Haggiag. This means that more progress needs to be made before distributed ledger technology can support mass transit systems. For these reason this could be a very innovative project!! Good luck guys",False

Our business model is designed to ensure smooth market penetration through lean and reliable processes, and our scoring and reward program ensures loyal and productive community. With the variation in fare calculation from one country to another and even from one city to another, RedCab LLC has managed to keep the tool flexible to amend the best pricing formula without surge price or high cost fare in holidays or bad weather. 2. Problem Solving: Why RedCab? Many start-ups have been rising in the market recently to solve the transportation issue. Most of them are successful as a business, but none of them have succeeded without a social collateral damage. Despite the fact that technology has bridged the gap for transportation needs and has successfully solved some problems in the past 10 years, this left us with multiple copycat business models without any iteration or innovation. Customers are not only searching for a trendy service, but looking for a true reliable service with sustainable quality and safety, that offers all transportation options and services with a low competitive price, and because customers hate to be abused; so on a rainy day, or a day with heavy traffic; “high rates” fare is not a good move. From another side, the main pillar in the transportation industry are the drivers. Based on a recent survey conducted on drivers working as part time for one of the major car hailing services App, 91% of the population have joined the hailing service Apps to increase their income and 87% to work flexible shifts. Our business model guarantees 20% increase in the income of drivers with a clear strategy to capitalize on the network dominance where the time of the people who chose to partner with us and drive is managed more efficiently. This will lead to a sustainable cost advantage. Therefore, increasing the demand, which will allow the average RedCab driver in a city to complete more rides in a given hour, and consequently lowering the cost on the user, and the process loops again. 10 Unlike car hailing big players’ strategy to subsidize taxi companies without a clear understanding of their business needs, RedCab was founded with everyone in mind. This is the reason behind resistance from taxi drivers to the new technology which was a main part of the world’s transformation in the transportation industry. Our business model is giving the chance for taxi companies and drivers to take advantage of the technology to keep their jobs and to capitalize on a market share that has dropped to less than 10% in the past 10 years. From a fast forward vision and aligned mission, we designed our business model to act as a massive support line to prevent community abuse and market domination. This will have a huge impact on communities on the long run. We managed to do this through our commission scheme and investment management, in which we margin our trips’ fares and invest in Geo generated promotional technology through deep learning and data mining in our monetization model. We implement this strategy without adopting any losses to dominate markets and direct our investments in futuristic technology like Auto drive cabs to gain more profits neglecting the impact on communities’ high rate of unemployment or neglecting the fact that only 30% of car owners work in hailing services in developed countries.",False

Without these ""middle-mens"" the driver will recieve 100% odf their salary while the transpaortation is getting much cheaper for the customer itsself. As i can see the team behind the project as observed the market for 8 years to see the transaformation, so i think they are wll-known in the car-sharing and transportation business. One other interesting aspect is that its not just a car sharing platform but they also have B2B-division including private limousines, taxis and delivery fleet. So they are also getting in direct competition not only with Uber but also the other flagships of the transportation market like UPS, DHL or TNT. This division is the more interesting for me because here the big money is created. Also great to see that this project didn´t only have a whitepaper and vaporware but a working product with RedCap-app which is available for Android and IOS users also.

Cabbi is registered as a trademark class 42 within the jurisdiction of Egypt in accordance with the Intellectual Property Law No. 82/2002. and we based the +4000 growth on the exponential forecasted growth of our network of users based on 3 levels referral program during the next 5 years. RedCab's expansion plan within the US is planned in Q4 2020 as mentioned in our roadmap and in Asia 1 year before that. Our expansion strategy relies on gradually reducing the cut percentage taken from the trip until we reach our model of 100% earnings to drivers and the only cost to the consumer is the fare of the trip through decentralizing the whole process by mid-2020. While the main cash cow relies on Geo ads contracts from commercial entities interested in targeting certain segments with specialized and tailored ads to lower their marketing costs and increase the fulfillment of provided ads. The market in Asia and the US is heavily dominated by big funded centralized companies indeed as Uber, Lyft, Cabify, grab, etc. However with our business model, and Proof of Driving integration to motivate drivers to get on the wheel to generate tokens as long as they're driving and accepting trips, we lower our operating costs and Proof of marketing to get our customers promote the app to their network and make tokens as long as their network of users are using the app, we lower our marketing costs. Our competitive advantage increases over time due to the inability of competitors to compete without taking a cut from the trip because their only sources of revenues are based on the high commission they obligate the drivers to pay, and the average cost to consumers after including the surged trips. Over time the RedCab network will eventually grow exponentially based on genuine demand from users because it offers a win-win situation for both parties, and while our costs are indirectly controlled as mentioned above, profits will be driven to the company as a consequence with above average annual ROI to our investors, hence giving us the opportunity to re-invest in R&D, acquisitions and carefully expand further.",False

Without these ""middle-mens"" the driver will recieve 100% odf their salary while the transpaortation is getting much cheaper for the customer itsself.

One other interesting aspect is that its not just a car sharing platform but they also have B2B-division including private limousines, taxis and delivery fleet. So they are also getting in direct competition not only with Uber but also the other flagships of the transportation market like UPS, DHL or TNT. This division is the more interesting for me because here the big money is created.

Problem: Uber, lyft, grab, etc are giving a service which is expensive to customers and not good to drivers because their commission is too much.  Redcab Solution: Decentralize the process and don't take a cut.  Result for community: Cheaper rides for customers and more money for drivers.  Result for RedCab: More people will use the app. which means more business to us.  How are we going to make money? Use the customers' data, analyze it, and sell them tailored ads  Why blockchain? and Why a Token? To give drivers a generated token to get them to drive with us, and to give customers tokens so they market us to their network.  Can we do it without blockchain? Yes, we can, but the blockchain solution will lower our operating expenses and increase our investors return on their investment.   How would blockchain lower the expenses? proof of driving will give drivers tokens when they drive so we don't have to pay them to keep our app open. (Operational expenses) proof of marketing will give customers tokens when they refer our app to their friends and family so we don't have to spend millions on advertising (Advertising expensive)   why should people invest in REDC tokens now? because the value of the token will increase when listed on exchanges  so is that a security token? No! it is a utility token.  So why would the value increase? Because the supply is capped, and it'll be used in everyday usage for payment in the app which creates organic demand on it. Limited Supply+increasing demand=Value appreciation.  but what if no one used the app? If you're going to work and need a ride and have two options. option 1 costs you $10, option 2 costs $9. it's a no-brainer what you will choose. if you drive with uber and get paid $8 after they take their commission, and with RedCab you get paid $9. it is also a no-brainer what you will choose. The app will work!   So what is the ROI if I buy REDC tokens now? We can't predict the future, but a recent study suggested that the ICO investor makes an average of 82% gain. We might be in the same range.   What exchange will you be listed at? We will confirm the name as we come closer to the listing date.   Please feel free to ask any questions you might have. it benefits you and the community. thanks",False

Operational company with concrete business plan that is quickly progressing on-ground. Regarding your comment for the private sale amount, you need to consider, that the bonus at the private sale is up to 42% during the last week. This is a great bonus for the buyers who are interested to invest more. However the private sale will be over in few hours and we are moving forward to the Pre-ICO starting on June 1st, where the minimum contribution of 0.1 ETH is a very affordable amount.

Proof of Driving, Proof of Marketing these concepts are registered intellectual property at RedCab LLC. (Registration number:   6239137959 registration can be verified online at https://www.copyrightregistrationservice.com/verify/). With the help of Blockchain, AI and Proof of Driving, RedCab is solving two major problems that are currently present on the market.  1. Problem: Price Fluctuations during peak hours  Nowadays during peak hours, riders have to pay higher prices for a cab as there is short supply. Through Proof of Driving concept, drivers will be motivated with tokens to accept more rides. This will prevent shortage on the market during peak hours and will stabilize the prices for a ride.   2. Problem: High comission fees for the companies  Currently the car-hailing services need to charge a comission from each ride to sustain in the business. RedCab is planning to gradually reduce this comission to 0% within the next 3 years. This will be beneficial for the driver who will receive more profit and for the rider who will save money. Meanwhile RedCab is planning to introduce Geo-Ads within the app and this should become the main profit source for the company. This way everyone in the community can benefit: Drivers have more profit, riders have more savings and local businesses can advertise their products to a targeted audience which decreases the ad-costs and increases the conversion rate.  Regarding your concern about the competition with the large companies. This concern is totally valid and here we need to clarify that our vision is totally realistic and we are not planning to compete with the big players at the current stage. We are a small company founded just 2 years back. Our strategy is to expand to small touristic places where we can gain customer-trust and perfectionize our services. The competition in small touristic places is not high which gives us a chance to grow slowly but steadily. The competition with the big players in the market may be considered in the long term period.  Regards,  Anna",False

RedCab's expansion plan within the US is planned in Q4 2020 as mentioned in our roadmap and in Asia 1 year before that. Our expansion strategy relies on gradually reducing the cut percentage taken from the trip until we reach our model of 100% earnings to drivers and the only cost to the consumer is the fare of the trip through decentralizing the whole process by mid-2020. While the main cash cow relies on Geo ads contracts from commercial entities interested in targeting certain segments with specialized and tailored ads to lower their marketing costs and increase the fulfillment of provided ads. The market in Asia and the US is heavily dominated by big funded centralized companies indeed as Uber, Lyft, Cabify, grab, etc. However with our business model, and Proof of Driving integration to motivate drivers to get on the wheel to generate tokens as long as they're driving and accepting trips, we lower our operating costs and Proof of marketing to get our customers promote the app to their network and make tokens as long as their network of users are using the app, we lower our marketing costs. Our competitive advantage increases over time due to the inability of competitors to compete without taking a cut from the trip because their only sources of revenues are based on the high commission they obligate the drivers to pay, and the average cost to consumers after including the surged trips. Over time the RedCab network will eventually grow exponentially based on genuine demand from users because it offers a win-win situation for both parties, and while our costs are indirectly controlled as mentioned above, profits will be driven to the company as a consequence with above average annual ROI to our investors, hence giving us the opportunity to re-invest in R&D, acquisitions and carefully expand further.  The plan is lowering our operating costs while growing the network of users and acquire market share while driving revenues from a different stream.",False

We sent them an email to understand how can we improve our score at the strengths and opportunities sections of the analysis, nevertheless, the criteria that define other aspects so we can improve on it?  Our priority now is indeed to work on the weaknesses. We started by updating our Github repo with our utility token ERC20 smart contract. https://github.com/Redcabllc/REDC  Partnering with a large company might be a challenge due to the scale of operations and cooperation at this phase, and the demands and/or financial obligations that such partnership might oppose on us. We strategically chose to partner with 5 start-up companies to become partners in success and grow together quicker.  RedCab LLC. was founded in 2016. We launched our MVP in late 2017 and started on-ground operations already in moving people from point A to point B within a tactically selected touristic spot by the Red Sea. Our ambitious roadmap will continue to develop regardless of the amount raised through our upcoming ICO. We raised our first round of investment in August 2017 and we used the funds to develop our MVP and start our on-ground Operations. We're planning to raise another round of investment by Q1 2020. That's why we're launching an ICO to give the community the opportunity to crowdfund the company and help us grow, develop our product and invest in infrastructure and marketing, list our REDC utility tokens in exchanges and consequently, appeal to investors when we raise our 2nd round. Our token distribution was built on a 38/62 rule with a total of 38% reserved tokens and with the 62% for crowdfunding being minted as contributions are sent to the contract address, hence we start the supply with 0 and build up. Total Circulating Tokens post-ICO will be 38,000,000 REDC + Minted REDC tokens from Private Sale + Minted REDC Tokens from PreSale + Minted REDC Tokens from Crowdsale.  To dodge the heavy competition from big funded centralized players, our strategy is to acquire market share in touristic spots because the competition is not as heavy as in capitals or big cities over there and will allow us to grow. Our first coastal city was Hurghada - It's a beautiful spot by the Red Sea. You should visit sometimes btw. Our second spot was ElGouna which is also a small touristic spot by the Red Sea. We're planning selected cities in Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Europe gradually during the next 3 to 5 years.  We are confident in our ability to compete with big players on the long run because our business model is different and robust, it is backed up by the community, and is solving a real problem while being affordable to the consumer from other companies yet more profitable to the driver. We're building Redcab to last, and that's why we have a strategy to subtly acquire market share and expand carefully till we have strong roots that'll allow the business to withstand heavy competition as we gradually ramp down from our current centralized business model and ramp up our completely decentralized model within the next 3 years as mentioned in our roadmap.  We noticed that some information was required, thus we will try to respond as much as we can.  ·       about the experience of the founders in the implementation of a successful business. The team behind RedCab has a track record in a combined professional experience of over 150 years in various industries, start-ups, roles, functions, and countries. Our team of Advisors shares the success of implementing successful and tangible businesses and we’ve worked very closely since the birth of our company as not to reinvent the wheel and to share the best practice in success. We’re bringing along our path to success experts and professional personnel to help us build our company. ·       about compliance with the legislation requirements of the securities market and on the taking preventive measures. We’re creating a utility token to be used within our platform, and we are not selling securities as carefully mentioned in our terms and conditions. Due to capped supply, and organic growth of demand in our service, the logical consequence of expected ROI will occur which will allow us to reinvest in infrastructure and grow further. Preventive measures in restricting investments from selected countries were taken. ·       about compliance with the legislative requirements for personal data protection and about the development of a Privacy Policy Our privacy policy is available on our website and updated as of May the 1st 2018. Due to the fact that we do not operate within the EU, the GDPR privacy policy update does not apply to the services we provide at the moment, thus not obligate us to update our policies at this stage. We are planning to update it, however when the business need arises. ·       about large VC investors in the project Our first round of investment was not large, however, we utilized the funds efficiently to launch our minimal viable product and start operations. We are currently within an ICO stage to crowdfund our roadmap, develop our processes and backbone, and seek a large VC investor as planned within 2020 to carefully expand our global market reach further. ·       about the safety audit of the smart contract We used Securify.ch formal auditing tool as well as SmartCheck https://tool.smartdec.net/ for vulnerabilities and bad practices. Due to the fact that we used POA wizard for the creation of our smart contract that is powered by Tokenmarket.net contracts and open zeppelin best practices, we did not come across any severe issues that might jeopardize the functionality or the safety of our smart contract. We’re also considering the opportunity to hire a professional auditing company for the thorough report.  Indeed the path ahead is long and full of challenges. Our main priorities at the moment are to expand our advisory list with experts and experienced personnel who believe in the success of our project and would indeed advice us and guide us, as well as hiring the right people from the tech and blockchain space to develop our protocol within time, and walk through our roadmap by developing a product that will impact our communities yet drive profits on the long term.",False
