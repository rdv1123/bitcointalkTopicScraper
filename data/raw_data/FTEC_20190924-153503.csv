Part 10. Is trendline trading strategy effective? 🤖 https://medium.com/@ftecfound/how-to-make-a-profit-with-ftec-part-10-is-trendline-trading-strategy-effective-8d7d65444141    A trendline trading belongs to strategies which are plain and simple even for trading newbies because you don’t need knowledge and additional using indicators when using this strategy. Today we’ll try to figure out if this strategy works accurately and if we can trade according to it without using other indicators of technical analysis.  As we’ve already mentioned, this strategy is quite simple and helps to determine trend direction and join the trend, finding the most profitable points to enter.  To build a line of ascending trend, it is enough to find 2 local minimums and put them together. In such case, the 3rd point, which is the closest to the trendline, will be perfect to open order.  But prompt entering the market is just half the battle. The time and place to set take profit and stop loss also play a key role. According to this strategy, take profit should be set at the level of local minimum (a kind of resistance level with which the price face when bouncing off the trendline).  This strategy also provides a clear instruction on how to set stop loss: you should set it at the level of the first local minimum that was used for drawing the trendline. Thus, we found and analyzed 20 situations when we could use the strategy. We provide all screenshots of found situations below.  On the basis of data analyzed, we can conclude that trendline trading strategy really helps to increase the effectiveness of trades. You can fully rely on it or use it as an additional tool.  The thing is that this strategy helps not only to get a profit but also to minimize risks, due to correctly chosen stop loss.  In 85% of situations we analyzed, the trend continued to the set take profit point. In other cases, we could minimize risks by setting a stop loss at the level of the first point, which forms the trendline.  As a result of our experiment, we made following conclusions:  Conclusion 1. Trendline trading strategy really helps to increase the effectiveness of trading and minimize losses.  Conclusion 2. This strategy provides a clear instruction on how to set take profit and stop loss so it doesn’t need additional indicators and can be used by a trader with any level.  Conclusion 3. If you work with small time frames, it is necessary to spend a lot of time, monitoring the price level.  The crypto world is moving on and there are many strategies which appear every day! You don’t need to spend a lot of time and efforts to monitor all of them because you just can use our Smart Trading System and bots will trade for you! 🤖  And FTEC Pre-Sale is live now!

So our strategy of entering the market is based on the main sections of the Roadmap for the upcoming year. In particular, it is a release of beta versions of the main ecosystem modules.  The task of creating a truly working ecosystem in the shortest time possible is the cornerstone of the development strategy for the upcoming year.  In addition, it is very important to take into account the constant change in trends and tendencies in the field of cryptocurrency. For example, almost every month new promising projects, coins and approaches to the use of blockchain technology appear. Our team clearly understands that being successful in this market means tracking these changes and offering new unique solutions.  📈 The long-term basis for the project’s development is the creation of a broad and active community. To achieve these goals, we have a well organized department devoted for communicating with our community in social networks.  Due to the already existing project, we are able to calculate the average price of a check (refill) of the user. We can also calculate a number of expected registrations, payments, and users who will refill their balance again.

Quote from: Mrjitter on April 18, 2018, 04:33:30 PM in which period of time after the end of the ICO, do you plan to join the exchange? and for how long will the token be frozen? The team's tokens will be frozen for a year. We plan to enter the exchange within 15-45 days after the Token Sale.  Quote from: dreico on April 18, 2018, 04:53:20 PM you have a plan in case sales go bad, what actions you take in this case and where can you read about this information? We have a plan how to develop our ecosystem in case if soft cap is not reached, hard cap is not reached etc on the website, the 'Token' section. For example, if soft cap is not reached, we will return ETH to the pre-sale participants and develop the project independently at a slow pace.

Quote from: MajorMining on April 18, 2018, 08:31:21 PM Why devops are necessary? Each module will be located on a separate server, so it will be necessary to provide support and configuration of these servers by system administrators. DevOps are required to coordinate commands between each other and provide their needs in external services.  Quote from: Seton on April 18, 2018, 08:41:03 PM What if soft cap is achieved and hard cap is not?

Since our main site ftec.io was blocked due to spam attacks, the FTEC Foundation security service has made every effort to restore the domain name.

As a result, our site with a domain name got into spam filters and even in SPAMHAUS.  ⚠️Today, 11/04/2018, we confidently declare that our users are not being spoiled by spam mailings from competitors. Thus, we once again proved the professionalism of our team and are confident that no external threats will prevent our project on the way to achieving the goal!

The reason was the incorrect and unprofessional competitors behavior. We are flattered that our competitors are so serious about us and it certainly speaks about the hype that our product creates on the market.  It was not sent by us, not on our behalf, domain or server!  📌 Massive spam mailing was sent,more than a billion e-mails (following the example indicated in the photo) in which they recommended and referred to our resource,and in consequence of which thousands of complaints was received. As a result, our site with the domain name ftec.io got into spam filters and in even SPAMHAUS itself.  We have nothing to do with this newsletter and protect ourselves against re-attack by creating a completely new secure domain https://ftec.ai. The subdomain zone clearly corresponds to our product, namely it means Artificial Intelligence.  This situation pointed out  our weaknesses and forced us to pay special attention to security.  Ftec.ai is our official secure domain and completely belongs to us. We will restore our first domain very soon. New official domain https://ftec.ai - a mirror for the smooth operation of the project!  In the face of the Ftec Foundation team, we apologize to all fans of our project!
