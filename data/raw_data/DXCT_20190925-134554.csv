DataXchain platform has two main levels: the service level for the provision of services in general and the infrastructure level for the use of blockchain technology, storage and processing of data and support of the system as a whole. The infrastructure layer is designed using the DXC-F (DataXchain Fabric) system, based on the blockchain system and  DataXchain file system, or distributed data storage system. DXC-F uses blockchain technology to ensure the security of transactions, eliminating the possibility of manipulation and control actions on the use of data. And the introduction of Hyperledger Fabric as a blockchain platform will create a solid foundation for the platform as a whole. Hyperledger Fabric can be used privately with the available permissive options, which have a much more extensive use compared to Bitcoin and the public blockchain network Ethereum.  The second element of the infrastructure layer of the platform, DXC-FS, was implemented in order to eliminate vulnerabilities in data storage using blockchain technology. Images, videos and many other forms of high-capacity data will be stored in DXC-FS via DataXchain platform, and the address will be stored in a blockchain providing superior performance without taking into account the storage of large amounts of data. DXC-FS will be the base of a distributed open source data storage platform, IPFS, which will help it to solve all its tasks.

The role of data in human life has changed significantly and has become more influential over the past few decades. In particular, the advent of the Internet has made exclusive data publicly available and has allowed countless people to use and distribute it. Practically we are surrounded by data every minute of our lives, not being able to influence this flow.  We are so used to downloading data from the Internet (images, videos, texts, etc.) that we often forget to ask: ""Who is the owner of this data and what does he get for this distribution?""The huge amount of personal data in circulation today is estimated at trillions of US dollars.

Anticipation Of A Good Rally   2018 was very interesting for top crypto. Moreover, at the point of $3500 - 4000, Bitcoin received serious support, which allowed experts to make optimistic forecasts for the end of 2018 and even further. The same happened to ether. Markets stopped in anticipation. Anticipation of a full-fledged pre-New Year rally.  The exchange excitement is regularly fueled by media people public appearances, that may have an impact on the market. It was just last month, Steve Wozniak, Michael Novograc, Nigel Green and Alexis Ohanian managed to speak out about the brilliant prospects of the ethereum. The first one stated that the ether in the long term ""can be as influential in the digital economy as Apple is in the real world."" The second one spoke out in the sense that no one needs to have 100 blockchains, one good enough is enough, and it can and should be ether. The last two predicted the Ethereum cost before the end of the year at the point of $ 2500 - 3000.  At the same time, ICO Genie CEO Akshay Mehra, former head of the Fortress hedge fund Michael Novogratz, and Tom Lee, who does not need to be introduced, managed to speak out in favor of Bitcoin. All of them see good prerequisites for the Bitcoin quotes growth in the form of limited emissions, which protect the cryptocurrency from inflation. Akshay Mehra considers Bitcoin ""the best of all stock exchange tools he knows, which are much higher than gold."" Novogratz and Lee also rate Bitcoin's stock market prospects very high. The first predicts the rate of cryptocurrency at the point of $ 40,000 per coin before the end of this year. The second - the point of $ 20,000, which still looks like a giant progress compared to today's quotes.  It should be said that all these optimistic statements are backed up by very real reasons. So, popularity among developers speaks for Ethereum, its blockchain is useful to business, besides, the ether has become the “default solution” for ICO. In favor of Bitcoin, it has vitality and ability to resist the most powerful pressure from regulators speaks. The following conclusions speaking for Bitcoin could be made out of recent news: Canada refused to tax cryptocurrency incomes, digital assets were recognized as legitimate means of payment in Germany, bitcoins are sold almost on every corner in Australia, plus the possibility of paying in BTC has been declared by Amazon.  As for our forecasts, if the pre-New Year’s rally does take place, then Bitcoin and the Ethereum should play all the losses of the beginning of 2018.  http://dataxchain.org/ico/main https://b.radikal.ru/b27/1811/c8/17092f1e2fa6.jpg",True

Identity theft, data leakage, trade in personal information-these are the problems of the modern Internet community. Blockchain offers a new approach that ensures the integrity and safety of digital data. We are confident that the development and spread of blockchain will have a huge impact on all areas of our lives.  And it is no more than a matter of time before blockchain technology is fully embedded in our daily lives. It is important for our generation to get acquainted with new opportunities and do everything to make them a reality. Through the project DataXchain we strive to counteract the contemporary reality in the market of digital data to create our own ecosystem of digital data, within which individuals can have ownership of information or data created by them, and to profit from the production of these data. This can prevent the data from being used to cause harm, as well as bring the power of ownership back into the hands of individuals – each of us.  https://c.radikal.ru/c31/1811/ef/8d4ab80a99d9.jpg",True

The role of data in human life has changed significantly and has become more influential over the past few decades. In particular, the advent of the Internet has made exclusive data publicly available and has allowed countless people to use and distribute it. Practically we are surrounded by data every minute of our lives, not being able to influence this flow.

DataXchain is a blockchain platform designed for the implementation of decentralized trade data. Thanks to decentralization, we will be able to create a new format of data exchange, according to which all rights to information will belong to its owner, not to the corporation – in contrast to the current situation in the data market.   Inside DataXchain platform, all transactions will be performed using DXCT tokens and recorded in the blockchain. Record in the blockchain about the transaction is necessary to confirm the fact of the data transfer.   Thus, with the help of DataXchain platform, each user will be able to create their own information assets, sell them and receive a reward for it. The establishment of a fair system of sales data and property rights protection on personal information – the main mission of the platform DataXchain.

Through 'decentralising' data ownership and trade, DataXchain aims to create a new data paradigm in which individuals, as opposed to data giants, own the rights to their own data and are equitably compensated if their data is used.

Our team sees this as an opportunity to introduce substantial changes into the way private individuals approach their income by creating a new financial stream as well as reimagining various aspects of their lives – work, education, leisure, etc.  According to International Data Corporation (IDC) research, the big data and business analytics market will grow from $131.1 trillion US in 2016 to over $202 trillion US in 5 years, provided the average compound annual market growth rate stays above 11.7%. Besides, according to the Global economic forum projections the price on personal data may reach €1 trillion by 2020, showing a huge leap of 317% compared to €315 billion in 2011.  Such situation on the modern digital data market opens up great opportunities for expanding and developing the DataXchain project.

DataXchain is a decentralized social service with a unique intelligent IME contention checking mechanism. The users of the service can be divided into two categories – data owners and data users. Both categories can cooperate with each other on mutually beneficial terms when exchanging data.   DataXchain is a completely new, self-developing active ecosystem where anyone can create their own digital assets (image, photo, music, text, etc.) and put them on sale or purchase any necessary digital asset from another user of the service.   The implementation of such a mechanism is made possible by the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts in the DataXchain project, on the basis of which transactions of payments for the data acquired on the platform will be conducted. All the transactions within the ecosystem will be carried out in its own DXCT tokens and recorded in a distributed ledger. Each entry in the ledger will serve as the evidence of the transaction which will help to eliminate any fraud while working with digital data.   The DataXchain system was created by our team in order to break up the monopolies of the centralized market giants and provide an opportunity for everyone to realize their potential in an intelligent digital space.

Blockchain is a distributed database, stored on a large number of computers in the form of a set of identical copies. These copies are constantly synchronized, so that any new records in the database are instantaneously distributed throughout the network. New changes are recorded in a single chain of information blocks.  The blockchain system is cryptographically protected - it means that the user can make new changes to the blockchain only based on his own previous actions. ""Third party"" editing would be impossible for him because of the lack of a cryptographic key associated with another user and known only to the latter.  Therefore, no blockchain record can be rased or changed, because it would response immediately on all nodes of the network, what is practically impossible. So, once been recorded in the blockchain, data can not be falsified or arbitrarily deleted!  https://c.radikal.ru/c01/1810/1e/d463698503f5.jpg",True
