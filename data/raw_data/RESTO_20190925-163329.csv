Resto is a 4-pack blockchain solution to the broad spectre of problems that foodservice operators encounter when it comes to designing and maintaining loyalty program for costumers. The quantity and variety of competing restaurants makes it much more difficult to maintain consumer loyalty, considering the predatory environment of the market.       Resto Loyalty Platform (RLP) — a customizable loyalty program. With RLP each foodservice operator can launch his own loyalty program just by completing a profile. The loyalty program gathers and aggregates information about each customer’s preferences, assigning him or her a personal ID and continues to monitor them further. It allows each restaurant to advertise their campaigns effectively, targeting customers according to their personal tastes, average amount spent, geolocation etc. RLP aims to integrate all the loyalty programs of different companies. Resto CRM — a ready-made solution for small and medium foodservice businesses to obtain all the information about business efficiency. Since Resto CRM is integrated with RLP all the marketing initiatives and profit accrual can be easily carried out in just a few clicks. Resto Wallet — a user-friendly app for the Resto Loyalty Platform. It allows using general currency for all the loyalty offers. With Resto Wallet each customer gets cashback from partner companies, acquire Resto tokens, transfer them to other RLP users or even exchange Resto tokens for any cryptocurrency or fiat currency. In the app instead of annoyingly irrelevant offers, customers receive only the attractive ones based on their personal tastes. Resto Wallet takes advantage of the QR-code function to make transactions more user-friendly than ever before. Resto Reviews — a unique feedback service allowing only real consumers to submit a review of a foodservice operator. It offers honest reviews from the real consumers that have visited the outlet. The Platform is extremely simple, allowing small businesses take pleasure in communicating with customers and make ratings grow to attract more potential consumers.  What is RestoToken?  RestoToken is a multipurpose utility token, that is designed to support the Resto platform in it’s goal of providing blockchain-based loyalty program for consumers and business owners and huge database for marketing specialists 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 Why do we need it?  ERC-20 token format is required to make app's interaction with blockchain tech as simple as possible. Blockchain technology allows us to create a Resto Wallet, Android and IOs app that allows us to provide safe, fast and independent way to hold and exchange RestoTokens.
