It's ASIC mining... Other most of the existing leading cloud mining companies are still using the older technology. And also, as I saw if someone purchase Securix Tokens, that means he/she invested in Securix on a mining machine worth of the value of the amount of tokens. Then when the mining machines mine bitcoins or any altcoins, the token holder receive a relevant percentage of that mined cryptocurrency. This is happened by increasing the token value.  And so the best difference is, Other cloud mining companies allow us to invest on miners only using USD, and we cannot withdraw that money even when we want them badly. But here we can withdraw the invested amount by just selling Tokens. That would become a attractive fact of Securix.  Ohooo... And that fact also tells us how the securix token increase its value gradually! Because Securix mine always the most profitable coin to mine. Ask me if anyone don't get this...",True

FUBT is a rapidly growing crypto exchange focusing on liquidity for new tokens.  FUBT mission is to make capital markets and trading available 24/7 T+0, with a broader range of asset classes. They aim to facilitate capital reallocation into promising businesses, which will foster job creation with higher productivity.    FUBT is ranked on Feixiaohao at place 17 and keeps improving the result as they feature;  · $250m+ daily volume · More than 1,200,000 registered traders · 130+ crypto pairs available for trading · Low trading and withdrawal fees   These are all reasons to take a serious look at Securix.io and their asset-backed SRXIO token with a generous payout.  For those not familiar with the Securix.io SRXIO crypto token;  A passive monthly income from a 45% gross revenue share from all mined Bitcoins. A strong departure from traditional mining operations which tend to only share net after overhead profit with investors. The uncertainty of ROI is removed as unforeseen expenses and overhead which can influence net profit will not impact gross profit. Owning the Securix SRXIO token will provide a guaranteed monthly share of gross revenues from the physical token mining operations run by the company in the Netherlands.  Securix is token driven mining, not cloud mining. While cloud mining has become popular, it generally provides only a 28–60-day contract that terminates if the operation is not profitable. Cloud mining forces customers to stay current by continually reinvesting to keep their hash rates competitive. Meanwhile, the SRXIO token of Securix.io has NO expiration and cannot be cancelled as it is utilizing the Ethereum ERC20 Smart Contract output distribution model. This offers a more sustainable long-term investment potential. While Securix is mining Bitcoin, it is making payments in Ethereum. It can be stored and traded using Ethereum compatible wallets and exchanges. Additionally, the token system rewards token holders with monthly payments.  The asset-backed SRXIO token that helps protect investors from the wild price volatility within the crypto markets. The SRXIO token will be backed by physical assets in the form of the hardware used to drive the mining operations.  Securix has initiated a Company Reserve; Valuing its long-term objective Securix.io is setting aside the initial 10% of its monthly revenue as a reserve. The contingency reserve ensures that all operations of the start-up perform optimally regardless of market conditions. This strategy covers token holders from short-term market shocks in that the reserve acts as a protective safeguard.  In addition to the Company Reserve, Securix will be initiating two investment strategies:  • Token Buy-Back;  Tokens will be bought back from the market at a price depending on market conditions. These tokens will then be burned. The token pool quantity will then decrease meaning monthly gross revenue will be larger as it is now divided across a smaller token pool.  • Mining Hardware Purchase;  If Bitcoin price is favourable an increase in gross revenue can be expected. The token value is covered by thousands of mining machines running at the Netherlands facility. New hardware will be purchased to increase production.  The Securix.io SRXIO is quite transparent as are the benefits to the Token Holders.  1. High gross revenue payouts to Token Holders in Ethereum 2. A Token Driven Mining System 3. Asset-Backed Tokens 4. The Company Reserve 5. Its Token Buy Back and Mining Hardware Purchase Investment  strategies… are just some of the many reasons Securix SRXIO should be here to stay.

In fact, Securix has based their mining operation in a 146-year-old sugar processing factory for that very reason. Covering over 10,5000 square meters the facility can accommodate up to 24,000 units capable of generating more than BTC 24.5 a day. With extra thick walls and a power infrastructure that suits their mining needs the facility is equipped to store thermal heat in a manner that allows Securix carbon footprint to remain as neutral as possible.  Securix has partnered with EXE Energy utilizing Decentralized Energy with its new EAN-2_EAN decentralized energy trading platform. Funded by a publicly traded energy company and developed by the startup EXE Energy Securix is able to purchase green energy directly from solar and wind generators. These alleviate the need for intermediaries and expensive third-party service providers.  Decentralized energy, much as its name implies, is produced close to where it will actually be used. Centralized energy, on the other hand, utilizes large plants based elsewhere and sent through a national grid.  By locally generating your power you reduce transmission loss and lower carbon emissions. Both economic and environmental benefits can be huge for the user of decentralized energy.Securix.io through their Netherlands mining operation is proving just that.  Lowering your carbon footprint is very important, and Securix.io is doing their part to do just that. Their token holders can take pride in knowing they are benefiting the global environmental landscape by utilizing a more environmentally conscious mining solution, while at the same time establishing energy prices that are more effective than traditional energy.  For more information on this and everything else Securix.io is doing check out our website.",True

Latoken is a rapidly growing crypto exchange focusing on liquidity for new tokens.  Latoken’s mission is to make capital markets and trading available 24/7 T+0, with a broader range of asset classes. They aim to facilitate capital reallocation into promising businesses, which will foster job creation with higher productivity.  LATOKEN entered Coinmarket Cap’s Top-50 in July 2018 and keeps improving the result as they feature;  · $30m+ daily volume · More than 80,000 registered traders · 180+ crypto pairs available for trading · Low trading and withdrawal fees   These are all reasons to take a serious look at Securix.io and their asset-backed SRXIO token with a generous payout.  For those not familiar with the Securix.io SRXIO crypto token;  A passive monthly income from a 45% gross revenue share from all mined Bitcoins. A strong departure from traditional mining operations which tend to only share net after overhead profit with investors. The uncertainty of ROI is removed as unforeseen expenses and overhead which can influence net profit will not impact gross profit. Owning the Securix SRXIO token will provide a guaranteed monthly share of gross revenues from the physical token mining operations run by the company in the Netherlands.  Securix is token driven mining, not cloud mining. While cloud mining has become popular, it generally provides only a 28–60-day contract that terminates if the operation is not profitable. Cloud mining forces customers to stay current by continually reinvesting to keep their hash rates competitive. Meanwhile, the SRXIO token of Securix.io has NO expiration and cannot be canceled as it is utilizing the Ethereum ERC20 Smart Contract output distribution model. This offers a more sustainable long-term investment potential. While Securix is mining Bitcoin, it is making payments in Ethereum. It can be stored and traded using Ethereum compatible wallets and exchanges. Additionally, the token system rewards token holders with monthly payments.  The asset-backed SRXIO token that helps protect investors from the wild price volatility within the crypto markets. The SRXIO token will be backed by physical assets in the form of the hardware used to drive the mining operations.  Securix has initiated a Company Reserve; Valuing its long-term objective Securix.io is setting aside the initial 10% of its monthly revenue as a reserve. The contingency reserve ensures that all operations of the startup perform optimally regardless of market conditions. This strategy covers token holders from short-term market shocks in that the reserve acts as a protective safeguard.  In addition to the Company Reserve, Securix will be initiating two investment strategies:  • Token Buy-Back;  Tokens will be bought back from the market at a price depending on market conditions. These tokens will then be burned. The token pool quantity will then decrease meaning monthly gross revenue will be larger as it is now divided across a smaller token pool.  • Mining Hardware Purchase;  If Bitcoin price is favorable an increase in gross revenue can be expected. The token value is covered by thousands of mining machines running at the Netherlands facility. New hardware will be purchased to increase production.  The Securix.io SRXIO is quite transparent as are the benefits to the Token Holders.  1. High gross revenue payouts to Token Holders in Ethereum 2. A Token Driven Mining System 3. Asset-Backed Tokens 4. The Company Reserve 5. Its Token Buy Back and Mining Hardware Purchase Investment  strategies… are just some of the many reasons Securix SRXIO should be here to stay.

But I still think and know that such a mining operation can be really profitable. I doubt that we can achieve such a high ROI as in your white part but even 50% would be enough.  So I participate in almost all your promotional campaigns and invested a few bucks.  Let's wait and see if I was stupid that I didn't learn on my mistakes (Envion ICO) or clever that invested despite that.  The part that you talked about been stupid got me laughing but yea, i feel your pain of been scammed, we've all been in that situation at one point in our lives, that was why i stated something  a while back, about the need for the community to just be optimistic and not judge a brand based on past mistakes of others, investments can be risky and profitable at same time  This time I invested in the place where I actually live so there will be no problem to give a visit to the office of Securix. With Envion was little too far to go to Switzerland but still doable for 50 euro from The Netherland. But there was no sense because offices are of course empty and founders hiding their addresses for obvious reasons.

For those not in the know, a cryptocurrency exchange is a website where you can buy, sell or exchange cryptocurrencies for other digital currency or traditional Fiat currency like US dollars or Euro.  Getting your new crypto coin or token listed on a cryptocurrency exchange is very important for any ICO or ITO. With an air of legitimacy, the exchange listing can often be what makes or breaks the interest, activity, and volume of trading in a newly listed cryptocurrency token or coin.  Being listed on one exchange as opposed to another can mean the difference of a new coin or token getting a lot of new interest, attention, recognition, and positive exposure. This allows it to take off quickly, receive a lot of purchases and trades, then reach terrific new heights.  Or just crashing and burning like so many do…especially those that are never listed on an exchange.  That is why it is of utmost importance that cryptocurrency projects, new and old alike, seek for the highly coveted listing spots on the world’s best and most respected crypto exchanges. A project may have a lot of potential but may not be able to reach that potential due to a lack of exchange listings.  A token being listed on a major crypto-exchange can bring about a lot of response and interest. This can also greatly increase the value and trading volume in a token or coin.  Think of a new stock. Or an IPO. Those listed on a quality exchange like the NYSE, Nasdaq, London, Shanghai or Euronext will receive a lot more attention and publicity than those traded Over the Counter or on Pink Sheets.  Similar to when a crypto coin or token trades among its peers on a major exchange or instead foolishly trades on its own.  Last year alone there were literally hundreds of new crypto coins and tokens that launched into a booming ICO market. However, many of these new coins and tokens failed to get in front of investors or the public as they didn’t get listed on a Crypto Exchange. This can be a catastrophic mistake.  Without being supported by an exchange, buying and selling a crypto asset becomes extremely difficult if not impossible. There is a clear relationship between the success of a cryptocurrency and the quality of exchange it affiliates with and lists on.  A highly respected crypto exchange is very safe and secure.  The positive effect and trust factor of being listed on a popular exchange has been quite substantial. This has allowed many new Crypto coins to achieve substantial new heights. Like any other investment do your own due diligence and do what is right for you, individually, as an investor.  Many Factors to consider when choosing a Crypto Exchange include;  · Security · Cryptocurrencies supported · Fees and commissions · Mode of payment · Geographic location · Ease of use · Trust factor · Levels of security to dissuade “hacker” and “crooks”  These are all reasons to take a serious look at Securix.io and their asset-backed SRXIO token with a generous payout.  Current crypto market conditions have been very challenging.  While Securix has been very successful during the private pre sale, the crowd sale has been challenging as the market conditions are not favorable at this moment.  it has been our goal to make cryptocurrency accessible to a broader audience. As of today, we at Securix still stand of that. At Securix.io we want to give everyone an opportunity to participate in the crowd sale offering.  While Securix.io will be extending their crowd sale offering (Please see chart below) the starting date of the mining facility will remain the same.    For Securix it’s of utmost importance to start as soon as possible with the mining activities, the extension of the crowd sale won’t have any effect on the start date.  This will give everyone an opportunity to benefit from buying an asset backed SRXIO token with generous 45% gross revenue payout each month!  Question: What Is A Crowdfunded Crypto Mining Company?

Things have changed drastically. Even brand new miners are worthless after 3 months mining other algos. The Antminer S9 had a life span of almost 2 years, that was almost miraculous.

Keep in mind the manufacturers will only sell these mining models if they are profitable, the BTC Value and difficulty plays a big role in this part.  With millions of buy in power, you can knock down the price. As you won't pay retail price, we are in direct contact with some manufacturers which we have signed NDAs with. The models they are presenting are very promising. Regarding the lifespan of the machines, that is why we have a re-investment strategy in place to keep the mining operation in peak condition in either re-investing in new miners and / or our token buyback program.  With our investment strategy we have a 2 folded approach: token buyback and burning program or reinvesting in new hardware, both options will increase output per token and token value.  1: buying tokens from the open market en burning them so that the total tokenpool decreases and output per token and token value goes up.  2: With reinvesting in new mining hardware we will increase the mining output and therefore increase output per token and token value.  We always choose the option which has the best Return on investment.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0b-_ktAe7k&feature=youtu.be.  If the market changes and we need to diversify portfolio of mining algorithms, than we for sure are on top of this. It has to be on a responsible way though, you need good coins to mine with decent market capitalizations.  The mining industry is thriving, but yet prone to market developments. We at Securix are on top of this!  If you still have any questions, feel free to ask them!  The Securix team   ",True

There are models out there which are efficient and which can produce a good revenue. Bitcoin is still profitable to mine, it all depends on your cost structure. Electricity is the biggest cost in the mining facility, on the website you can check the average indication price. With the EAN-2-EAN platform we can buy even cheaper. We are buying our energy green + all excess energy produced. The range will be between 0.02 and 0.05 euro cents because there is no more intermediary in between.  The energy we buy is green energy, Bitcoin mining uses so much energy, its a fiduciary duty to the environment to buy the energy green. We believe sustainability, profitability and responsibility can go hand in hand.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQSNYavt_W4  As a fellow miner, you know the ropes but if you still have questions feel free to ask us!

Regarding the FUD, this has been properly addressed in the according Bitcointalk thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5036757.new#new.  Quote: Dear All,  We were genuinely flabbergasted, about the way of things have gone about. A very aggressive stance towards Securix.io, making outrageous allegations like SCAM which is not taken lightly. All these allegations had no foundations and were based upon opinions. We at Securix have questioned ourselves what the agenda is behind all of this?  People in the community have a fiduciary duty to protect the good projects because if people just looked at some of the social media’s of our team members the allegations would have never been raised, if people in question had the intention to ‘’investigate’’ Securix. They found a picture which looked like it has been photoshopped, and there the rant and baseless allegations started with the intention to harm Securix and its reputation.  Internally our team first was shocked, is this real? Some Sherlock Holmes saga of a guy trying to unmask Securix. Well guess what, there is nothing to uncover because we are real, we are working every day on this, we are making Securix a colossal success.  Our team is working every day very hard and are working on this project for 1,5 year now. It’s not justified, nor it gives people no right to make this a witch hunt. All questions have been adequately answered. Still, people seek connections and motives which do not exist.  1: Using older pictures, newer pictures or whatever photo from the location is our business. It does not state anything. Securix shows the community where the miners will be located.  2: A professional photographer shotted profile pictures, and still people are seeking a motive behind it. If maybe the images are not real or?  3: It came to our attention yesterday that some of you guys have mailed the owner of the building to investigate if we will be located over there. Well, we are as a result of this, we post the emails.  Mail A: https://MVP.securix.io/MAIL_A.jpg Mail B: https://MVP.securix.io/MAIL_B.jpg Mail C: https://MVP.securix.io/MAIL_C.jpg  * Before the next Sherlock Holmes spots that some of the e-mails contain an e-mail signature and logo, some don’t. We have no idea what causes this. We think it has something to do with the HTML body when sending the e-mails  If you do not like Securix and their offering, no offence taken but we won’t accept FUD being spread under the false pretense of ’’protecting the community’’. We do not accept bad mouthing of Securix in the forum from no one.  We accept feedback and constructive discussion; we are all for that. But Securix is not wasting any more time on combatting ridiculous cases and allegations.  Kind regards,  The Securix Team Unquote:  This is the end of the FUD and let us continue with a good and constructive discussion! If you have any questions, feel free to ask them!

Difficulty curves have skyrocketed on all algorithms. Only people qualified to speak on this topic are seasoned miners. I consider myself to be one, I have run many large farms and have had many partners invest millions into these projects. I was on the phone with a partner last week who wanted to get started again, I told him not right now...the ROI is just not there right now. Farms are hurting right now guys. Genesis Mining (also in Netherlands) is one the biggest players who's been around the longest can hardly pay their operating costs at the moment. And don't give me this horseshit PUP model....It's simple, you put thousands of miners in a warehouse and payout dividends to all partners involved. Call it whatever you want but at the end of the day it only does one thing and that's mining crypto. Only place your gonna shave overhead is cheap electricity, bulk ordering on asics, cheap labour and favourable cool climates with tax breaks. Putting a token on the project does not create magic. Listen people are getting out of mining right now and there is a reason for that.  But not all is lost, there are still ways to be successful in mining and I keep reading to see if you guys talk about it. But you don't, and I'm not about to hand over to you the secrets I've come to learn since 2011. But I can see you guys aren't miners, that is very clear. You talk a lot about how you have a magic trick that's going to make it profitable but you don't speak of the technical, the real nitty gritty about mining.  I wish you the best but I'm afraid anyone who invest's into mining at this stage in the game is money lost.",True

The plan is not relevant now, just a quick reminder that the big mining farms are thriving more than ever. ASIC mining is very profitable, but it all comes down to the criteria's in the PUP method. Securix wants to strike a balance between cost per unit, efficiency and energy usage. Securix is ready for all the new brands ands models an the best return of investment at the time of purchase. We use the ""Power Usage, Unit price, Performance"" or ""PUP"" model. Buying hardware is organic and is prone to market developments. The type of hardware Securix will buy can change over time.

The Netherlands is known for an ideal climate and power grid for data centres:      * 99.995% Energy grid up time   * Dutch air outside is cold enough, below 22 degrees Celsius to permit sustainable data centre cooling 97% of the year   * Lowest average latency in Europe   * Due to the presence of the Amsterdam internet exchange, The Netherlands has become one of the world's most significant internet hubs.   * Politically stable due to the Dutch consensus model in both politics and economics      To ensure successful execution of its ambitious business goals, the company's management and staff members are living and working in the same country as the mining operation - the Netherlands. With a highly committed and vested group of founders, Securix is already ahead of its road map, having upgraded their infrastructure and electricity.  From my understanding they will be buying it off cheap since it is green energy; That usually does not cost to generate hence is cheap to buy. I think the challenge is when bitcoin's price goes below their set numbers which is likely. I understand that there is a pool in place but the pool can sustain a certain period only.  The prices for energy are very stable in The Netherlands as we have a lot of generators. If anything changes, we will share this information with the community.

Yes, from all mined Bitcoins yes!  At Securix.io, we’re offering our investors a share in our gross revenue. This differs greatly from most tokens that are only used when they’re being traded on exchanges. Of the few token that do provide a return to holders, the return is based on a profit sharing model- which comes with many more risks to token holders.  We at Securix are all about transparency, so let’s take a look at the differences between a gross profit share model, and a gross revenue share model:  Net Profit Share: 🔹ROI can be impacted by unknown and/or excessive costs. 🔹The entrepreneurial risks are shared among TOKEN holders. 🔹There is a large uncertainty on the ROI.  Gross Revenue Share: 🔹ROI depends solely on the revenue generated by the company. Therefore, there is no way in which the company can inflate costs, and cut down on the profit being shared among investors. 🔹All entrepreneurial risks are carried by Securix. 🔹Far greater reliability on ROI, as revenue is more certain than profitability.    💻To learn more about Securix.io and how we plan on being fully transparent with our investors, grab your SRXIO tokens at https://dashboard.securix.io !",True

We have certain strategies in place. First of all, its important to know the reason behind purchasing an SRXIO token.  This token gives you a passive income, a secure investment. The majority of the investors will keep this token in their wallet to receive this. For the ones who want to sell at the exchange we have our token buyback and burning program.  Every month 10% of our gross revenue(of all mined Bitcoins) will be used for the program. The token pool will decrease in volume and scarcity will arise. Better part yet to come, the upcoming pay out the output will be divided by a lesser token pool which result in a higher output per token.  Regarding the listings, we are talking with 4 big ones. We strike a healthy balance between value and costs to list the SRXIO token.  Key selection criteria:  • Safe and secure • High liquidity • Right amount of traffic and volume • Established an exchange platform with a positive history • Suitable to buy, sell and store SRXIO tokens  We can be listed from 7 - 21 days, so it won't take long. When we closed the deal, we will announce the listing + exchange.  If you still have any questions, feel free to ask them!  Kind regards,  The Securix Team",True

We raise capital to buy tangible assets - mining hardware. Every token that is not backed, is a devaluation of the total token pool. That means the ROI decreases over time, we have capped bonus phases as well.  When the token limit or bonus phase end date is reached, the next phase will start. We are protecting our current and future token holders and making sure we do not devaluate our token. This will result in a higher output per token  All these strategies are in place, to ensure that the ROI will be kept high. Everyone benefits from this, so you have to see it that your 3% is more valuable than a devaluated down 5%.

This platform allows us to cut out the intermediary in this case the big energy company.  The green generator can sell a bit higher and we buy in even lower.

About the numbers 17/19, in The Netherlands you can make multiple units inside a location each unit will have their own building number. This means that if this building has 10 units, it will result in 10 unit numbers which can be 17a, 17b, 17c, 18a, 18b, 18c and so on.  The people on the video are us, you can identify us at those video’s they zoom in on our faces as well. We will upload our introduction video’s on YouTube + on our white paper which you can view at https://www.securix.io you can see our team plus their LinkedIn profiles links. We strive for full transparency so here are the inside pictures as well with us inside of the location.  https://MVP.securix.io/INSIDELOCATION.jpg https://mvp.securix.io/INSIDELOCATION1.jpg https://MVP.securix.io/INSIDELOCATION2.jpg https://MVP.securix.io/INSIDELOCATION3.jpg https://MVP.securix.io/INSIDELOCATION4.jpg https://MVP.securix.io/INSIDELOCATION5.jpg https://MVP.securix.io/INSIDELOCATION6.jpg https://MVP.securix.io/INSIDELOCATION7.jpg  2: The return on investment is sustainable, the crypto mining thrives. The 178% you just mentioned is including the bonus, we gave the option to look without bonus as well. We at Securix have opted to show different scenario’s to the investors because the Bitcoin price determines the return on investment. That results in that you can personalize your sentiment on the market and check out the different return on investment scenario’s. When the Bitcoin price moves up, you earn more. When the Bitcoin price moves down you earn less. Simple and transparent.  3: The re-investment strategy. This is an important part to increase your investment, we have an buyback and burning program which results in a smaller token pool and higher output per token and token value will increase due to scarcity. Or we choose to acquire new mining hardware, these new machines will create a bigger output at the end of each month. So even after your investment Securix is busy to create added value and your token will have a greater output and rise in value.  4: How much will I earn in 5 years? We’ve given % of ROI so you can calculate out what you can expect. We have as well pointed out the market and mining challenges as described in the white paper white paper https://securix.io/marketing/page%2044%20risk%20and%20regulations.pdf. A lot of factors are in play, with the mining market keep in mind that the founders and management are a large stake holder in the mining operation. So every decision will be in the best interest of the token holders as they are token holders as well.  The Founders tokens are locked from 30 November 2018 till 30 November 2019. Starting from November  2019 the Founders will receive each month 5% tokens from their 15%.  If you still have questions, please feel free to ask them.  Securix Team",True

Securix is an operationally ready cryptocurrency mining solution. The company is committed to simplifying investment in cryptocurrency through its innovative asset-backed SRXIO token, environmentally conscious power generation, and easy-to-use Mega Vault Wallet app.  Securix’s mining operation will be located in an old sugar factory in the Netherlands. This site was specifically selected based on four core requirements: strategic placement, safety, security, and scalability.  The factory(Video location:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCBR5dxyEXY&t=5s) is over 10,500 square feet, 3 stories high, and large enough to house 24,000 mining units. With all of this infrastructure, Securix will be able to mine up to 24.5 Bitcoin on a daily basis.  With a clear future vision, Securix is run as a company with a ready to go product. Our SRXIO token generates a passive income in cryptocurrency each month.  1: As an industry first Securix has implemented a 45% gross revenue share from all mined Bitcoins to all token holders. This means that there are no hidden cost structures plus it has a high output per token compared to projects that give their investors a net profit share.  2: We also have a superior investment strategy in the form of a token buyback & burning program; buying new mining hardware. Both options will increase the output per token as well as the token value.  3: The selection of our mining hardware is rigorous and is subjected to our PUP model (Performance, Unit price, Power usage). This will result in het best ROI per mining hardware unit.  4: Securix buys their energy green through a decentralised energy platform called EAN-2-EAN. Which allows Securix to buy directly from the green generators: solar fields, wind turbines.  5: We are also proud to announce that we are in the process of upgrading our electricity capacity to 7MW, this achievement puts us ahead of our roadmap.  6: The founders and management of Securix FZ-LLC are also the founders and management of Fintech Capital B.V. For the team it was essential that we would mine in the country the team is living in; therefore the mining facility is operated in The Netherlands.",True

Securix is an operationally ready cryptocurrency mining solution. The company is committed to simplifying investment in cryptocurrency through its innovative asset-backed SRXIO token, environmentally conscious power generation, and easy-to-use Mega Vault Wallet app.  Securix’s mining operation will be located in an old sugar factory in the Netherlands. This site was specifically selected based on four core requirements: strategic placement, safety, security, and scalability.  The factory is over 10,500 square feet, 3 stories high, and large enough to house 24,000 mining units. With all of this infrastructure, Securix will be able to mine up to 24.5 Bitcoin on a daily basis.  With a clear future vision, Securix is run as a company with a ready to go product. Our SRXIO token generates a passive income in cryptocurrency each month.  1: As an industry first Securix has implemented a 45% gross revenue share to all token holders. This means that there are no hidden cost structures plus it has a high output per token compared to projects that give their investors a net profit share.  2: We also have a superior investment strategy in the form of a token buyback & burning program; buying new mining hardware. Both options will increase the output per token as well as the token value.  3: The selection of our mining hardware is rigorous and is subjected to our PUP model (Performance, Unit price, Power usage). This will result in het best ROI per mining hardware unit.  4: Securix buys their energy green through a decentralised energy platform called EAN-2-EAN. Which allows Securix to buy directly from the green generators: solar fields, wind turbines.  5: We are also proud to announce that we are in the process of upgrading our electricity capacity to 7MW, this achievement puts us ahead of our roadmap.  6: The founders and management of Securix FZ-LLC are also the founders and management of Fintech Capital B.V. For the team it was essential that we would mine in the country the team is living in; therefore the mining facility is operated in The Netherlands.",True

Securix is an operationally ready cryptocurrency mining solution.

This means that there are no hidden cost structures plus it has a high output per token compared to projects that give their investors a net profit share.  2: We also have a superior investment strategy in the form of a token buyback & burning program; buying new mining hardware.

Yes, we are very aware. We are not a cloud mining company, not a fancy website and that is it. No we are Securix, a token driven mining company.  Our team is legitimate. All of our team members actually work with us, and contribute to our operations. These are Dutch team members, that are getting paid by our Dutch company—living and working together in the Netherlands. Our founders are highly committed and vested in Securix—we have already signed contracts for our location, and for our necessary electrical upgrades. We've done all of this before we’ve even reached soft cap.  With the signed deal we are already ahead of road map and preparing  the facility for all the miners. The facility is can house up to 24.000 mining machines and is capable to mine up to 24.5 Bitcoins each day. The founders and management are huge stake holders in the mining facility and represent a 15% share in tokens. Every decision we make, are in the best interest of the token holders and thus us. Our focus is to start as soon as possible with the mining operation.  We will mine Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash whichever is more profitable. The reason is very simple, these coins have both the highest market capitalizations. We strongly believe in Bitcoin and the blockchain, miners are needed for the blockchain and we at Securix are ready to play a big role.

Therefore, there is no way in which the company can inflate costs, and cut down on the profit being shared among investors.  🔹All entrepreneurial risks are carried by the COMPANY.  🔹Far greater reliability on ROI, as revenue is more certain than profitability. _____________________________ 💻To learn more about Securix.io and how we plan on being fully transparent with our investors, check out our website  (http://www.securix.io)!",True

This is why we’ve broken down how our revenue will be distributed, for everyone to see.   · 45% of ALL gross revenue will be distributed equally to SRXIO token holders. These earnings will be distributed through an Ethereum smart contract to ensure full transparency.   · 37% of the gross revenue will be reserved for operating expenses, such as electricity, maintenance, and overhead. As costs can be variable, we are ensuring that they will not have any effect on the gross revenue output to SRXIO token holders.   ·10% of the total mined Bitcoin volume will go towards our innovative company improvement program. These funds will either be used for reinvesting in new mining hardware and infrastructure upgrades, or to buy back and burn SRXIO tokens.   ·8% will be allocated as profit for securix.io. This is also an estimate, and will not influence the SRXIO token holder gross revenue output.
