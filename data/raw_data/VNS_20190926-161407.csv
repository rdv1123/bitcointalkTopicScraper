In most cases, price tends to decline once they are in the market. And $2/token is pretty expensive to maintain. What are the contingency plans of the team to stabilize their token price? It's very hard to attract investors right now. So they need to have alternative plans on how to attack such situation here. Otherwise, small or big time players will just wait their exchange listings.",False
