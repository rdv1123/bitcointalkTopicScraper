Following are the key reasons that made GigTricks use the Hyperledger Fabric in order to make the Ecosystem secured, trusted and scalable for the community members:  1. The use of Hyperledger Fabric will allow the Ecosystem participants to store and share their data and information privately within the participating nodes of the Blockchain.  2. Its practice of collaborative software development approach ensure transparency i.e. it does not let public access to the personal data but it will allow other Ecosystem members to access certain data based on the settings and protocol defined.  3. For the secure transaction, GigTricks will use the Ethereum Technology, but to prevent the incurring transaction fee, the Hyperledger Fabric will be there to assist the Ecosystem.",False

I see the vision clearly for entrepreneurs but how can be they ensure that the data is safe? Will be ledger is enough for this?  Hi There, in the GigTricks point of view, the freelance and on-demand economy are lacking the principle standards to form a trusting business relationship between clients and freelancers. GigTricks will be seeking to build a blockchain-based ecosystem to increase transparency, trust, and reliability among platform participants (i.e. clients and freelancers) with the help of its 5 innovative products integrated into a single ecosystem and here they are :  - GigTricks PRO (A Blockchain based verified resume portal where you can showcase your skills) - GigTricks Learning (A learning platform where you can learn and earn blockchain based verified skill) - GigTricks Social (A social platform for a purpose - freelancers can earn coins by contributing and interacting with other community members) - GigTricks Marketplace (Ultimately a blockchain based marketplace where now buyers not only can see overall profile ratings but also they can filter the skill ratings and can find the best talent for their business) - GigTricks Point of Sale (POS) - (a point of sale machine which allows every freelancer or professional to start a business locally by using GigTricks PoS device and all local orders will boost their online profile as well)  Therefore, we will scale and increase the trust level by revolutionizing the freelance and on-demand community with the help of blockchain technology. All transactions and the review system within the blockchain will be immutable therefore, the ecosystem will be robust and tamper-proof for storing data. Moreover, disputes and the review system will be handled in a decentralized fashion, thus increasing the sense of trust among the community members.  With the leverage of blockchain technology GigTricks will maximize trust and transparency for all ecosystem participants, just like freelancers will feel more secure while taking on the gigs as no one can wrong them; entrepreneurs will be more confident while hiring freelancers as they cannot get away with their unprofessionalism and unethical behavior that cost small businesses their time. And just to give your answer, GigTricks is already live with its marketplace, it is essentially a badge of authenticity for us that we don't cease to flaunt!  People are investing in our ICO because just as our main sale will end, within 4 weeks of time, our GBTC tokens are expected to be listed on the exchanges. Meaning that the investors will be able to sell their tokens if they wish to. However, we encourage people for holding tokens for longer period of time since it can get them huge return on their investment.  So in conclusion, we are not launching GigTricks Ecosystem only to become a little better than the existing platforms 😊, we are here to revolutionize the freelance and on-demand economy and that is why we have thought of all our innovative features in a way that can bring the most benefit for freelancers/sellers and clients/buyers. And yes, we don't need to compete with anyone, when our ecosystem will go live, its features will attract people globally to leverage the on-demand industry.",False

Currently, most professional profile platforms have no verification mechanism which truly validates the skill mentioned in any profile. To overcome a possible scam in terms of mentioning skills and expertise, GigTricks has formulated a skill test. For example, if a graphic designer indicates “Adobe Photoshop” as a skill set in his GigTricks Pro profile, then a test will appear which contains multiple choice questions as well as qualitative questions which would be checked and analysed by various algorithms. These algorithms will be tasked with correctly scoring the test and provide an accurate skill rating.

GigTricks Point of Sale (PoS) devices are connected directly with GigTricks Blockchain. The aim is to make it easier for entrepreneurs to sell their goods or services and the goods will be paid by GBTC making it all secure and safe. For example, if a training provider has to offer his course locally at his physical institute, he will first launch the offline or online course in the GigTricks Learning Platform. Subsequently, by using the GigTricks PoS device, the user will be able to start sales at his physical location and clients will be able to pay for the course or any product or service using GigBit Tokens. Freelancers can also use the GigTricks PoS devices to receive payment for the services rendered by them for any offline clients, the sales ratings will also be recorded in GigTricks Blockchain for any offline orders. This will give the freelancer more credibility and will also boost their overall sales by bringing more orders into their profiles from offline sales.",False

The way people used to work and manage themselves is evolving with the changing work habits. The unconventional workforce has its privileges and the potential to create job opportunities. However, when there is no one around to supervise, you sometimes become laid back in completing the gig till another day and it may badly affect your income, reputation, and growth as a freelancer. You must manage your time in an efficient manner to leverage the most out of the opportunities at hand.  As a freelancer time is equivalent to money, being an enterprise in oneself freelancers are required to manage their time effectively to optimize their performance and earnings. If a freelancer cannot measure the time, then he cannot know his worth. Before signing up for any project it is crucial that the freelancer analyze and evaluate that how much time the project will take to complete and how much effort will go into the project completion. For new freelancers, however it is a difficult task, but to stay in business and succeed, understanding time and its value are vital. https://medium.com/gigtricks/2-simple-ways-to-keep-track-of-time-while-freelancing-b451254610cb  How Time Management Can Make a Difference? As a freelancer, things that matter are your skills but to utilize your skills, your time management skills must be optimum. It does not matter if you are a content writer that is creating ideas and jotting them down or a graphic designer in charge to respond ideas through images, graph, infographics, and art, or even a web designer who creates corporate websites or fashion blogs. Whatever your skills are, as a freelancer time tracking must be your priority. It is crucial otherwise achieving your goal within the deadline will become a nightmare.  So, to make your life a less hectic and more organized; and to help you out in completing more gigs in less time, here are two simple approaches.  1. Go Traditional — Measure Your Work 1.1 Set Your Milestone 2. Be Techy in Your Time Management 2.1 Be Smart with Time Tracking Apps 2.2 Be Creative — Follow Both Approaches  https://medium.com/gigtricks/2-simple-ways-to-keep-track-of-time-while-freelancing-b451254610cb",False
