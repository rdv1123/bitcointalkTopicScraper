At first, we will be aiding in the setting up of system parameters (e.g. fee values and time periods), but we aim to make it fully decentralised by mid 2018.  The idea of the full decentralisation is that we want to create a global standard for ticketing exchange that anyone can plug into and use, that isn't controlled by any one entity. It solves the problems of unregulated touting, counterfeit tickets, lack of oversight, and finally artists not reaching a wider audience. By making it fully decentralised and creating a pool of events on the protocol that anyone can add to and anyone can sell tickets for and gain commissions, we allow anyone to become a promoter thereby letting artists reach a wider audience .",False

We have 2 main industries we are targeting, which are very affected by fraud and touting issues.  (1) Sports - if you look at boxing matches and stuff like this, tickets start at £500 and then end up on secondary markets at £20k 5 mins later! We can fix this problem. We are looking at English football teams now and hoping to apply our solution there.  (2) Music - look at Adele tickets, which went to £9k last year after being released for £30! She was really upset about this. We plan to tackle the music industry with this.  The solution really applies to any ticketing, but as I said mainly where touting is an issue. We could do airline tickets or bus tickets, as it would make it a bit more efficient, but its not as important there.  The other thing - what we plan to do with the protocol and token is to create a global open pool of events that anyone can sell tickets for and gain commissions for doing so. So, now social influencers, community chat apps, promoters, other ticketing apps, etc and basically anyone can build a frontend and sell tickets to curated events from that list to their communities. So now, events can reach a wider audience and sell more tickets.",False
