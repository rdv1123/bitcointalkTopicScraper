I have a few questions before I consider participating in the ICO:  1) Is there a time limit for closing loan positions? Some ICOs last for awhile.  2) What happens if someone is at net loss at the end of the loan term?  3) Will the final loan re-payment be tied to the initial cost in fiat money or initial number of tokens put in? If it is number of tokens, the fiat amount of the loan will fluctuate with token price over the loan term.  Edit: Took a look at the android demo video, and changed some questions.",False

It means that if the cost of all the cryptocurencies bought with a cryptoloan goes lower than on -30% the smart contract would automatically payback the loan in order to protect cryptocredit funds.  3) It will be tied to the number on NIMFA tokens you get. We will be working hard on risk-management procedures in order to balance the loan a person takes with a loan a person pays back.  Max, Nimfamoney Founder & CEO",False

Nimfamoney does't provide a borrower with a loan directly. What we do is opening a positon on Nimfamoney with 300% funds from all NIMFA tokens a person has.  Let's say someone has 1000 NIMFA ($1000) and he gets a cryptoloan: 3000 NIMFA ($3000). Then he can get Bitcoins, Ethers and other cryptocurrencies with this loan but a person can withdraw to his own wallet only the part of funds that is more than $3000.  So if BTC raises to $6000, a person can withdraw to his wallet $3000 and payback the 3000 NIMFA ($3000) loan.  Does it make sense?  Max, Nimfamoney Founder & CEO",False

Russia.    why should i buy in your ico? anything special this project?  Nimfamoney is the world's first 100% decentralized cryptocurrency lending platform. Here you can borrow NIMFA tokens with a zero percent interest rate, use them to purchase tokens from other blockchain-organizations that come to an ICO or directly on the exchanges.  You don't have to sell your house, take a loan in a bank, borrow money from your friends, call your brother in the middle of the night with a request to lend you a couple of thousands for buying tokens from the company that is starting an ICO in just an hour.   Here are just six (but not all of the) reasons for you to benefit from our ICO:  — 100% confidential NIMFA token lending procedure without personal data collection — No verifications and denials, 100% automated cryptocurrency lending with a zero % interest rate (only 10% commission on profit) — Receive up to 260%* of additional income from each investment made with borrowed NIMFA tokens — Decentralized and automatically replenished cryptocurrency loan fund is without control by one organization — Triple profit for you: each NIMFA token bought on the ICO allows you to borrow 3 tokens — 2.5%* bonus in NIMFA tokens from all NIMFA token purchases made on the ICO by the persons you invite for participating on ICO  Look how the prototype works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95W9dh_-LIU   i will support just free project  Go help yourself, buddie    Max, Nimfamoney Founder & CEO",False

Yes, it's ERC-20 token.    now i need to lend some money to participate in the ICO XD, i'll see what can I do  I can kindly advise you to participate in the pre-ICO on July 30 because you'll get 96% DISCOUNT and will buy NIMFA tokens for ~$0,2 per NIMFA only.    how much will be the price of this token?  PRE-ICO DISCOUNT: 96% PRE-ICO PRICE: 1 NIMFA = 0,0008 ETH (1 ETH = 1250 NIMFA) ICO PRICE: 1 NIMFA = 0,002 BTC / 0,02 ETH PRE-ICO PERIOD: 30/07/2017 — 02/08/2017 SELLING 1000000 NIMFA tokens (5%).    but what would happen if the token is dumped? if i have 100 NIMF and the value drop, to like 3 o 2 $, my lending is reduced too, and therefore my investment  For example you get 10000 NIMFA tokens on pre-ICO ($0,2 = 1 NIMFA): that's $2000. ICO price is 5$ for 1 NIMFA.  After the ICO you'll be able to take a 300% loan. So if you have 10000 NIMFA you'll be able to take 30000 NIMFA loan ($150 000). LOOK AT THIS MAGIC MOMENT: You bought 10000 NIMFA tokens on pre-ICO for $2000 — and after ICO you can get a $150 000 loan in NIMFA tokens (1 NIMFA = $5).  NIMFA token must be 75-TIMES DUMPED in order to someone to take losses. This is highly unlikely to happen.  Max, Nimfamoney Founder & CEO",False

Great questions! I'll give you the answers you want to read.   QUESTION ABOUT ESCROW: Currently we're in a process of choosing people with ideal reputation in the [Suspicious link removed]munity for our escrow.  QUESTION ABOUT OUR UNIQUENESS: Our cryptolending platform is build for newcomers who have not much experience with trading but who would like to WIN BIG AND EARN MORE ON CRYPROCURRENCY MARKETS. It means they can know nothing about margin call. We give 300% funds to anyone in just minutes. No need to waste weeks and months to dig deep into margin call and other complicated trading procesess.  QUESTION ABOUT MONEY PROTECTION: Imagine that a person gets 1000 NIMFA tokens ($5 = 1 NIMFA) on ICO and takes a 300% loan: 3000 NIMFA (=$15000). He uses this loan to buy ETH and BTC. But if the principal's amount value (2000 NIMFA) goes lower than 2000 NIMFA we'll automatically transfer principal amount to 100% decentralized cryptolending fund in order to protect it's value.  QUESTION ABOUT ICOs AND SCAM: We will strictly filter the ICOs that a person would have a chance to participate in with his loan.  QUESTION ABOUT SECURITY: We'll start Nimfamoney cryptocurrency lending process from easy steps and will be making it more efficient with the time. However the whole system that Nimfamoney would build on it's smart contracts will be as much secure as possible   Max, Nimfamoney Founder & CEO",False
