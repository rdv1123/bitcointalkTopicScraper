UniFox helps with all crypto transactions, from buying, money transfer, exchange, storing, spending and withdraw back to FIAT. The project is divided into 5 parts, which are 100% autonomous. However, its connection is what helps us to fulfill our vision. Our project consists of:  Online Exchange Platforms ATMs Stable Cryptocurrency (Unicash) POS Terminals Decentralized Exchange  Our vision is to make the cryptocurrencies useful for the people.  We are making cryptocurrencies achievable all around the world We are making cryptocurrencies spendable We conduct FIAT & Crypto to one common cryptocurrency We will help cryptocurrencies to stay independent and decentralized  Info  Official Website  Whitepaper  OnePager  Unifox – The Concept The Unifox blockchain ecosystem is composed of 5 independent parts interconnected by the blockchain ecosystem. These are the following parts:  Stable Cryptocurrency, Unicash and Payment System (UXC) + prepaid cards Payment Kiosk Network (Crypto-ATMs) Online Exchange Platforms: Unichange | Cryptofin | Coin2Cash | Cryptocoin Oficina POS Terminals Unifox Decentralized Exchange  4 out of 5 products are already made and ready to be used, Unifox has already invested $7,000,000 into development and has been building entire crypto ecosystem (infrastructure). The reason for this layout is the link to all transaction options in the current economy. These options make up 3 basic pillars of Unifox:  I.   Exchange offices and ATMs represent the infrastructure for purchase and sale cryptocurrencies II.  Unicash and POS terminals represent a pillar for the use of cryptocurrencies III. The Unifox Exchange is a pillar for holding and trading cryptocurrencies   By linking these 3 pillars in one system, the cryptocurrencies become available and usable  https://i.imgur.com/FfkyQ3S.png             Exchange Network  As apparently possible to see from the scheme, the exchange network has the main mission to serve as a gateway to cryptocurrencies from the FIAT world in the form of bank accounts and online wallets (and back). The exchange network is one of the cornerstones of the entire Unifox system, each exchange office in the network is connected to different currencies and different payment methods, this ensures that it will be possible to buy cryptocurrencies on local markets using local payment systems. Exchanges are already functional finished products.              Network of Payment Kiosks    https://i.imgur.com/g69bfAU.png                 Similarly, as exchange offices in the system represent a gateway between electronic money and cryptocurrencies, the kiosk network represents a similar function in cash. Small transactions between cash and cryptocurrencies are, as it results from the background part, one of the very demanded services. Therefore, payment kiosks operating as cryptographic ATMs form one of the basic inputs to the Unifox ecosystem. A Payment Kiosk is a hardware device that is designed as a multifunctional payment terminal. At the first glance it reminds you of a regular ATM, but its features are far more widespread. All kiosk transactions are processed through the Unifox blockchain.                         Unicash – Cryptocurrency and Payment System  Unicash (UXC) is a common accounting unit for the entire Unifox ecosystem (not an ICO coin) that is stable in comparison with FIAT. Unicash will run on Unifox blockchain, performs the role of a unit that is the only one fully compatible with the world of cryptocurrencies (and therefore applicable within smartcontracts) and also the FIAT world money. The Unicash payment system is a user-friendly web wallet, whose unit, which is held here, is the universal Unicash cryptocurrency. For even greater user’s comfort, however, the account status is also displayed in the FIAT currency (the customer chooses). The main added value of the wallet is its interconnection with the network of Exchange Offices, Kiosks, POS Terminals, the Unifox Exchange and Credit Cards. Unicash forms the main link of all parts of Unifox and thus also link to FIAT currencies.              POS Terminals    A POS terminal (or Point of Sale) serves as a medium that mediates customers acceptance of money to retail traders. Most of the terminals are currently old-fashioned and have no capacity to receive cryptocurrencies, Unifox comes with a solution of high-quality POS Terminals connected to Unicash, Unifox POS Terminal is an exit point, in which the user makes use of the option to pay in cryptocurrency when purchasing. The terminal will ensure the acceptance of cryptocurrencies (as well as regular cards) in the shop for customers, the trader gets his/her chosen FIAT currency into his/her account (the settlement takes place via a link with a partner exchange office). Unifox, thanks to its capability to use cryptocurrencies in stores, carries out a whole range of projects integrating cryptocurrencies into the economy. These terminals are not only developed but also ready for mass sales.  https://i.imgur.com/b1fmX2q.jpg                        Decentralized Unifox Exchange  Unifox already has its own blockchain technology and decentralized Unifox exchange running on it. Unifox exchange will be the ultimate platform for the entire above-mentioned ecosystem. All of the above-mentioned projects thus form the infrastructure for linking the exchange with the economy. The exchange works on the Unifox blockchain technology and all transactions are managed through smart contracts. The exchange is fully accessible through the Unicash stable cryptocurrency. Regardless of the technological difficulty of processing transactions on the exchange, the user environment is extremely friendly. Even the novice user should be able to make a deposit, exchange and withdrawal.  Such an application is available in 3 basic ways: I.     Basic NODE and PC applications (maximum security + anonymity) II.    Electrum wallet + Mobile APP III.   Web wallet – desktop or mobile – on-line client              FOX Coin  FOX token is a utility and security token at once - FIRST TOKEN OF ITS KIND. The FOX Coin will play a very important role in the Unifox system, is a base unit of the Unifox blockchain and also has a crucial role to play throughout the project – it is the key to executing transactions across the entire Unifox ecosystem, fees have to be paid in it. In addition to being a token that makes use of technologies available, it is also a security token through which FOX token holders will be included in the entire Unifox business and would profit from the business’ success. Token holder will be eligible for dividends, 100% of net profit of the company is divided among the holders of FOX.    Presale To Be Announced!
