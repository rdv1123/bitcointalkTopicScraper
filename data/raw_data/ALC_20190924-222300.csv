We started with ICO a few months after the bitcoin bubble burst. It was just begininng a bear market on the crypto and a sentiment among investors was getting weaker and weaker at that time. However during this uneasy time, we have sold more than 17,000,000 ALC and ICO experts rated our project very well (in most scores about 4,5/5 or 8,5/10).  Furthermore, we need to emphasize that CEO of Aligato had created a very strong team with experienced professionals from different areas of business. It is also worth to mention here about our partners: Liga BTC, ATB Coin, Cryptomedics, Akademia Internetu and Comparic.pl. We have built Aligato office up and organized Aligato event for investors in Warsaw on November 7.  Currently AligatoCoin (ALC) is available on two exchanges: Bitkop and Kanga. We have a plan to list ALC on a new exchange in the first half of 2019. Developers started a work on AligatoWallet and the new layout, for the new version of e-commerce platform Aligato 2.0, is nearly done (despite of last difficulties). We also created a separate webiste Aligato.org in order to share financial statement of the project.  Generally all the work is constantly in progress. We sometimes encounter difficulties but it is normal because it is globally innovative project (among other things: cryptocurrency, drone delivery system, blockchain and pay via eye system). Overally the scheduled tasks are consequently carried out. Our idea of changing the reality is so strong and looking at our roadmap, the new year promises to be very exciting.""

Yes I see, in fact most of us invested seeing the vision and the team behind the project. Aligato 2.0 should be releasing with full functionality and new layout in this quarter of the year. But the worrying part is implementing the blockchain on the platform may well take more time. So unless the team develops everything according to the roadmap and with more care I fear this project will soon release a statement saying they have failed and will start to refund investors. Let's hope this does not happen. Bought ALC during the ICO at $0.5 which now worth $0.00019 on Bitkop exchange with almost no trading volume there    This is frustrating to see another project in which so many of us have invested heavily is based on the functionality of Aligato platform and token price is related to the platform's usability. At this point we can only hope the team can produce everything according to the roadmap and do a bit more marketing to attract users.

We can hear a lot about the new methods of hacking identity or other attempts to steal our money. Modern hackers are really creative, they invent a lot of ways to make our life harder. On the other hand, a lot of entities like social services and banks are implementing new ways of protection to improve their security-level.  Combined passwords is not enough  Not so long ago, in the early 60’s, password inventing was perceived as a true revolution. Finally, someone discovered how to protect our data in a smart, easy, and affordable way. Initially, it was used only by a limited group of people but when the internet bubble has begun, it became a common tool used by every average internaut. For these times, it was a sufficient way to feel safe (as long as you haven’t picked the 12345 or admin-admin combination). But with growth of the whole internet-based business and the development of technology in general, even this kind of protection was insufficient.  Nowadays, when each one of us is fluently using the web, it’s no surprise that our accounts have become a magnet for hackers trying to steal our money or — more and more often — data.  It all started with password cracking — it’s based on recovering data that have been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. The most common way to break your securities is using a brute-force attack. It consists of an attacker trying out as many passwords or passphrases as possible with the hope of finding the match.  There are two ways of carrying out this method. The first one is based on a dictionary vocabulary being cross-checked with yet unknown password. The second one is based on the use of the most common phrases or combinations of letters and numbers. The brute-force attack requires a high computing power but nowadays, even average internauts use really strong machines, so as you can guess it’s not a problem for the more advanced users.  2FA as an extra layer of security  One of the most popular and common ways to protect our passwords is the use of Two-Factor Authentication. This method adds a special layer to your account by requesting approval in form of a code from an external source . There are 2 ways of using 2FA and they are very similar.  Both methods use a special code that you have to enter after successfully completing the first step of access. It can be delivered via text message or a third-party app. Using 2FA is really simple and it makes logging into your accounts by unauthorized persons much harder. Biggest disadvantages of using 2FA? Well, if you’re using a dedicated app that reveals one time pass-code on your display and you’ll lose your mobile phone, the effects might be really messy. The worst thing that might happen is the possibility of losing access your account. Moreover, if your mobile phone is out of battery, you won’t be able to log into your account.  Using the 2FA is significantly increasing your safety on the web. We think that connection of 2FA and our Pay via Eye technology makes it practically impossible to steal any of your digital possession. How will it work? We’re planning to implement the technology in the front camera of our drones. You can decide which kind of protection you’ll use. It might be just a password but we will give you an opportunity to use an unhackable method of payment and collecting goods. Imagine a world where everything happens automatically. You order a product, the drone delivers it just outside of your door and then verifies your identity. As you might have seen in AligatoCoin 2.0 Whitepaper, the core of our vision consist of drones delivery, AI and aforementioned PvE system.

Why does the AligatoCoin project might have an unique opportunity to change the game?  We live in a times, where buying and selling has never been easier. If you want to buy music and, preferably, without leaving home — you’re going online. If you want to buy something extraordinary — the biggest chance to find it is to search the web. The world went crazy about online shopping, Poland is no exception. The studies show that over 50% of the polish internauts in 2017 bought at least one item online, and this figure is still increasing. The whole e-commerce branch is worth almost 40 billions PLN, and it’s just the beginning of a true shopping revolution. If I were to find a connotation for phrases “Poland”, “e-commerce” and “revolution”, the first thing that comes to my mind is Aligato platform.   Why AligatoCoin project is so revolutionary?  Online shopping market in Poland is very fragmented. On one side, we have a few bigger shops, that already exists in each bigger city. They went online, they serve their products on the web, so you can buy domestic appliance with door-delivery. On the other hand, we have the biggest polish online shopping platform, Allegro.pl which is definitely retreating. Latest reports say, that they still have an enormous percentage of the whole market share. Initially, it was the best place for small local merchants, who planned on making their businesses wider. Few years went by and unfortunately, in our minds, things have changed for the worse. With each day we hear more and more negative charges thrown in their way. Privileging the biggest companies and huge commissions are just a few of them. In Aligato.pl we believe, that there is still an undeveloped niche for small retailers, and that is a starting point for our new idea. We don’t want to favour the biggest entities. Actually, we don’t want to favour anyone. At the same time, we also don’t want to attract clients just by utilising an opposite scheme to our biggest opponent.  Therefore, we’ve added few more features to our vision of e-commerce. Blockchain-based cryptocurrency which makes things safer and more transparent , 2FA authentication and innovative, never seen before Pay via Eye technology explained in more detail here https://medium.com/aligatocoin-io/pay-via-eye-connected-with-2fa-your-data-has-never-been-safer-a77231615106 and delivery drones, which can make delivery faster, cheaper, and easier.  We have everything to make our idea successful. Our country has educated an incredible amount of engineers, who are implementing an innovative ideas all around the world. We were leaders in the blockchain technology development a few years ago. Even though things have changed we still believe that if you have a promising idea, great and highly-motivated team, you can make even unbelievable things real. Surely, it will take us a while to project everything and make it function as intended for the average internauts. We’ve started few years ago and with each day we see, that there is no elusive things in business. No doubt, that we will need a lot of money to finance the whole initiative. We aim to go head to head with the biggest — that’s why we launched an ICO!   https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*v09RgneL1BbTQuO1lrc36w.jpeg",False

Right now, the industry is having slips in its conveyance framework. In spite of the fact that some online business stores had included visit bots as AI use, much work stays to be finished.

Next year the online retail giant Amazon will turn 25 years old. However, the share of e-commerce in retail is still mere 12%. The few top companies on the global market introduce improvements and new technologies not vigorously enough. This is when Aligato comes to the game. The Aligato team believes that the status quo can be challenged. The cutting edge blockchain-based technologies that Aligato 2.0 platform has in store will enhance safety, stability and transparency of the e-commerce at a level unobtainable by the solutions available so far.  ♦ What Is Aligato 2.0 ♦  Aligato 2.0 is a e-commerce platform that will make the buying process easier for both parties by providing unique, pioneering solutions based on newest technological achievements, while maintaining traditional methods where they function without any problems.  Purchasing goods and services online can be challenging. Buyers are worrying if the product they’ve purchased will comply with a specification, and whether the payment and personal data will be safe. Sellers want to ensure a best user experience for the buyers to increase their loyalty and drive future sales. Aligato 2.0 responds to these challenges by providing an ultimate blockchain-based solution that would satisfy both parties.  Uploading all product data into blockchain will allow buyers to verify the authenticity of the goods and find good bargains on products perfectly meeting their demands in just one click. Alongside decentralization and multi-node verification will radically improve the security of stored and transferred data, protecting customers from credit card data theft and other threats.  The patented Pay via Eye (PvE™) payment system, operating through cameras in customer devices, will additionally enhance the security of customers. At the final stage of the purchasing process, the item will be delivered by autonomous delivery drones. The Aligato team is now developing necessary technological, logistical and legislative solutions, and some of them are already designed and patented.  ♦ The Aligato ICO ♦  To accelerate the implementation of Aligato 2.0 system, the Aligato team is running an ICO, collecting funds and rewarding the contributors with AligatoCoins. The ICO will be live until 30 November, 2018. Aligato team believes that the funds raised through ICO, as well as collaboration with strategic partners within the e-commerce industry, will enable them to implement their global vision as soon as possible.  AligatoCoins (ALC) are available for purchase on the aligatocoin.io website. It is possible to pay for them with BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE and ATB. One ALC is worth $0,5. Over 3,9 M of ALC has already been sold, which means that the project Soft Cap (1 M of ALC) has been reached.  After the ICO the Aligato team will continue working on the development and launching of the AligatoWallet beta version in the Aligato 2.0 framework, as well as on creating their own blockchain for the needs of the platform.

The history of Aligato began in 2014. At the time Aligato.pl was the fastest-growing online stores in Poland. In its first year it managed to garner over a million items available for sale. Who could’ve thought something would go wrong? Yet it did. As time went by, the project faced more and more issues with suppliers who couldn’t stock enough goods or had no proper information about their inventory, etc.  All that affected the quality of service for the online store user in a negative way. Its creators — Bartosz Juraszek and Adrian Dymarczyk, have come to a shared conclusion: the project must be relaunched.  As a result, the concept of the Aligato online store has changed considerably, while the project itself was renamed to Aligato 2.0. The use of blockchain allows to increase transaction security by a substantial margin. The user interface was simplified to the maximum and an AI customer support helping clients every step of the way was implemented.  The core of the platform will be its proprietary token — Aligatocoin that can be used as means of payment (featuring non-existent fees) for both goods and services on the platform. Less than after a month after the end of the ICO (30.08.18) Aligatocoin will be available for use as a full-fledged exchange-traded investment vehicle.  Aligato 2.0 features an undeniable advantage for investors — the existence of a marketplace that has been operating effectively for multiple years.  The project’s road map is well-detailed and implies that upon reaching certain fundraising milestones on various implementation stages, a multifunctional marketplace with an educational module (effective sales training), an iris recognition payment system (Pay via Eye) and drone-powered order delivery.  Aligato 2.0 beta will be presented to the public early 2019.

Where did the idea for Aligato come from and how did it all start? In 2014, we launched aligato.pl as an online store. In a short time, we had exceeded 1 million products available on our platform. Unfortunately, communication problems with suppliers, wholesalers, and sellers (shortages in warehouses, errors in replenishing their inventory) led to the necessity to change the functioning of Aligato. Two years later, we decided to change the type of platform into auction and sales.  What is Aligato 2.0? What will be different from the first version of the platform?  At Aligato 2.0, we focus primarily on transaction security. The blockchain is ideal for this, because every transaction it contains, stays in it for life, without the possibility of removal or change. We will change the look of the platform completely and simplify the management of your account to the limit. The implementation of artificial intelligence will have the task of supporting the user at every stage of purchase or sale.  Offered products and services will also be purchased using our Aligatocoin token. As a result, users will receive greater billing opportunities and significantly reduced transaction fees.  Pay via Eye (payment system using the iris) and delivery of drones are the next steps on which we will start to work after the publication of Aligato 2.0.  Why did you decide to use blockchain to create a new platform?  Blockchain gives us much more opportunities. First of all, as I mentioned, security. Any attempt to cheat something written in a blockchain will result in the loss of credibility of the seller or buyer, forever. Secondly, data scattering means more security for the portal itself. Thirdly, it will speed up the platform’s operation. However, the most important argument in favour of blockchain technology is the minimized transaction costs, which will translate into service costs. Also, we will give users the opportunity to profit from the Proof of Stake function in two variants of nodes.  Where did the idea for an ICO come from? Why did you choose this form of project financing?  We want to become a global platform that uses new technologies. These platforms are functioning thanks to community involvement. The best solution for obtaining funds for the development of such a website is a form of crowdfunding. In our case, because we will be a hybrid platform, gathering funds in a cryptocurrency society is a good solution.  Why should the AligatoCoin token be used? What will its real applications be?  AligatoCoin (ALC) will be a means of payment, both between the parties in the transaction and the methods for settlements within the platform. We will pay for PoS functions with our tokens. From the moment of entering the stock exchange (stock exchanges), you will be able to trade with our token.  Based on AligatoCoin, we will also prepare a payment gateway for other marketplaces.  Do you also intend to accept cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, LTC, etc?  We are considering it. However, we would like users to use our token. A large turnover of our currency will give users more benefits. At present, we are also in negotiations with the American company ATB and the owner of ATB Coin for closer cooperation and providing the possibility of purchasing Aligatocoin using ATB Coin and payment options on Aligato.pl.  Why should investors be interested in your project? How do you plan to guarantee their returns and future investment gains?  I think that the fact that we are not just an idea but a trading platform that has been operating for several years is a big plus for us. In addition to trading in a token, Aligato will also have profits from commissions, advertising and other products that we implement. In the case of products that we patent, there will also be profits from sharing and selling our technological solutions (including providing logistic services and security in payment transactions and securing sensitive data). We will share our blockchain with other projects.  What actions do you plan after completing the ICO?  Follow Roadmap. I can reveal that at several points of our roadmap we are already at a more advanced stage than expected. But we will inform the community about it only when we are sure that we have achieved these goals 100%.  How do you want to compete with existing trading platforms? Where do you see your advantages?  It is easier for new and smaller companies to adapt to and implement new technological solutions. The community, investors, and users are all very important to us. We are building Aligato together with our community. They set our goal and let us know what they expect from us.  The second most important thing for us is that thanks to our solutions, we will be able to minimize the costs of servicing the portal. Everything we save on, we want to translate into users.  On our fan page, we published five visual versions of Aligato 2.0, in order for our users to decide which direction we should follow.  An essential element of our competitive advantage is that we will also be a learning platform. We want to give our users a high dose of sales training. It is in this action that Maciej Dutko, a well-known figure in the world of e-commerce, will be involved  When do you expect AligatoCoin will be available on exchanges? Do you already have any deals with exchanges?  Immediately after completing the ICO. One of the proposals we have received is from HitBTC. We have also sent inquiries to many significant crypto exchanges.  When will you upgrade your platform to Aligato 2.0?  The beta version of the platform will be available at the beginning of 2019. The pace of our work depends to a large extent and will depend on the funds obtained.",False

Platform Aligato 2.0 based on the blockchain technology, will adapt the following associated facilities:  1. Placing all data about products and their origin on the blockchain will allow potential buyers to verify the authenticity of the goods sold. It will also allow you to find products more accurately meeting the requirements of recipients, as well as finding the same item with another supplier at a lower price. Suppliers will be able to verify whether the specification of the goods they produce is correctly presented by the sellers. It will also enable tracking the supply chain to check whether up-to-date and real information about inventory levels of suppliers and sellers will allow buyers to obtain reliable information or if the seller actually owns the product and will enable consumers to buy and collect the parcel in the shortest possible time.  2.The number of users of ecommerce platforms and the amount of data exchanged among them is huge. The data record based on the blockchain will significantly reduce the number of processes and prevent the necessity of repeating them repeatedly. It will also reduce data duplication and eliminate the risk of data loss.  3. Aligato users sensitive data security will be much upgraded. Better mutual verification of buyers and sellers will reduce the risks associated with transactions, and the safeguards provided by blockchain technology will reduce the risk of theft of personal and financial data of Aligato users.

To quote Businessinsider, less than half of all ICOs in 2017 (48% to be precise) were considered a success. And of the $ 5.6 billion raised, a quarter was collected by the few largest ICOs.  What about this year? According to the Coinschedule in 2018, the total number of 517 ICOs have raised over $ 11 M in only the first 6 months of the year. However, only 265 ICOs have managed to raise 50–100% of their planned hardcaps, whilst only as little as 18% of their hardcaps. Once again, about $ 4.7 billion was collected by the 10 top projects, including Telegram, Petro, TaTaTu, etc.  With that in mind, 2018 promises to be a true year of the ICO. With competition going strong, one can call 2017 the year of the ICO. Lots of projects failed to reach their targets during their tokensales. Be it a weak whitepaper, poor marketing, lack of trust from the investment community, non-existent token value, or a combination of all of these factors.  It’s time to forget about the “homemade” ICOs of 2016 and 2017. Developing an MVP is an ICP’s success in 2018. Aligatocoin already has an MVP — you can see it right now!

CEO has a rule - we cannot tell people news until anything is confirmed or done because we would not like to speculate but there was a brainstorm of course  Quote from: joblessminer on May 16, 2018, 08:00:09 PM Quote from: CryptoICOs on May 16, 2018, 10:58:09 AM Quote from: Dreaming on May 15, 2018, 05:16:59 PM Quote from: CryptoICOs on May 15, 2018, 05:28:50 AM Quote from: Dreaming on May 15, 2018, 12:48:45 AM Quote from: nuhoang924 on May 14, 2018, 05:16:18 PM This project looks great!
