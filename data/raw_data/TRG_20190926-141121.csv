Whenever a security breach or malware attack occurs, there suddenly appear thousands of bricks flying towards blockchain with one word written on them all — Hype. Blockchain is overrated, this is how the saying goes. Cryptocurrencies and ICOs are just one big bubble and blockchain itself is more of a tough talk than an actual change.  Could we presume that it might be true? Perhaps, instead of throwing bricks back to blockchain haters, developers and enthusiasts should ask: are the issues truly non-existent?  Blockchain IS overhyped It’s about time we face it. Instead of going on some crazy rants trying to prove the innovation’s worth, let’s face the issue as it is. Blockchain is highlighted in media all the time, and it’s not always done right. Innovation’s advocates, with their loud statements and big words, contribute to this reputation more than haters do.  Why does blockchain have a reputation for being an overrated innovation?  Whenever a worthy technology appears, people start talking about it. Browsing through media headlines, we see no fewer articles about Artificial Intelligence or chatbots than about blockchain.  It’s not the issue of how much people talk. It’s the question of what they say. What are the reasons of blockchain getting this status — among all other technologies?  Reason #1 — Media does not know blockchain so well  When at the end of 2017 Bitcoin started growing like crazy, everyone was talking about it. Of course, media had to take the lead. The real madness started. The words ‘blockchain’ and ‘Bitcoin’ that you could firstly read on dedicated tech resources, started spreading to mass media.   Source: https://lfb.org/gold-meat-rise-bitcoin-carnivores/  Awareness, brought to the innovation, contributed greatly to its development but it also became its curse. Not only blockchain and Bitcoin were perceived almost like synonyms but also, neither some of the journalists, who highlighted the topic nor their readers, could properly understand the nature of the technology — and its risks.  CoinDesk has even a dedicated article about it, and we share a great quote here:  The Internet gives you the power to go directly to knowledgeable sources on most topics — the real experts — and leapfrog the info-gatekeepers. Every topic has a specialist news service and hard data. For bitcoin, there’s CoinDesk, Kaiko, Reddit and a bunch of others. If you want to go deeper than that, pretty much every bitcoin insider and expert has their own blog. Jon Southurst  Reason #2 — Social media don’t know blockchain as well  Again, as soon as something walks the line of the mainstream, it’s evident that social media supports the hype, nevermind the absence of specific knowledge. When you go on Twitter, you see plenty of experts and just curious minds, willing to ‘explain blockchain’.  Sometimes there are some real gems from people who worked with the innovation from its beginning, but also those who have just heard a word “Bitcoin” and think that this is what blockchain is about.  We won’t give any particular examples (not to offend anyone) but you can find them on your own. It’s enough to go to Tweeter and search #blockchain — and enjoy.  Reason #3 — Blockchain is a funny word to pin in  As soon as innovation conquers the market and mass media along with it, it’s so tempting for businesses to keep their company up to date. For that, the latest innovation is picked up and hugely advertised.  Even if the development team is well-qualified and business owners made serious efforts to understand the technology, it often happens so that the mere use of blockchain is irrelevant for the business.  Innovation for the sake of innovation is not the best strategy. 92% of all Chinese BitCoin projects have already proven it, failing in less than a year.",True

Initially it will include models developed by Triggmine, but later independent third-party developers will also be able to join the network and get their rewards. - Computing resource providers: AI-based and general data  computations will be performed by decentralised network of computing nodes, which will ensure the quality of the results. We plan to use existing third-party network for decentralised computing, like Pandora Boxchain, SONM, Golem or other, which will prove to be the most robust in production-operating mode before the system launch. - Mailing agents: nodes performing e-mail campaigns based on the results of marketing algorithms and models run by computing resource providers. These nodes can use centralised services or build their own mail delivery solutions. - Analytic providers will collect data on the actions users do with the e-mails and aggregate them into statistics accessible to eCommerce providers, developers and mailing agents.
