Pantercon is committed to supporting start-ups with innovative, future-oriented ideas as they are founded. The presentation of their idea, from which they intend to originate the start-up, is done by means of a white paper. Insofar as their idea is accepted, they present a promising cash flow forecast and Pantercon is testimony to a promising future perspective, they receive the necessary seed capital. Without company entry and bureaucratic hurdles. We consider it more sensible for founders to focus on the essential.  The implementation of their groundbreaking ideas!    Pantercon enables them to use time productively instead of hindering themselves with business plans, capital market prospectuses, narrow-mindedness and endless bureaucratic hurdles. Many probably fail because of it and throw the shotgun in the grain.    A failed idea is a lost idea!           WHAT MAKES US SO UNIQUE?    When investors invest their money in crowdfunding projects, these are usually so-called subordinated loans or mezzanine capital. Investors are dependent on their assessment of the project, which is often difficult and it is risky to invest in only one or a few projects. (Investor limits)  The capital invested in Pantercon is not invested in one project, but in many different, carefully selected start-ups. This method minimizes losses for investors.  Pantercon's evaluation program offers investors a unique opportunity to help decide which companies receive support. The Hydra Blockchain will be a hybrid blockchain that combines the advantages of public and private blockchains. For the implementation, sidechains are used, which can be managed parallel to the manchain and operated relatively autonomously. The number of transactions is significantly increased by bundling, hedging and collective verification of several transactions. The advantages that Pantercon offers both for investors and startup founders over platforms such as Kickstarter, Crowd Circus or Conda make the signs clear for us, which makes Pantercon the winner.             Be part of the PanterX Token sale!   The PANX ""PanterX Coin"", the Pantercon project and the HXP ""Hydra Exploration Token"" stand out from the Hydra Blockchain currently under development. The first is traded as cryptocoin on the Hydra Blockchain, which represents shares in the company for participation in the evaluation program and results in distributions. 1 billion PANX are produced, 500 million of which are put into circulation.  The PanterX Coin allows the generation of the HXP token. The HXP is the fuel for the hydrane network. This is used to pay dApps, transactions, distributions, etc. This is generated by storing the PANX on the Pandora Wallet with each new Hydra block. On the other hand, it is used for the returns of the supported start-ups and for distribution to investors. Those who hold PANX benefit from this. With the release of the Hydra Mainnet, the PanterX token migrates to the PanterX Coin. In addition, the generation of the HXP (Hydra Exploration) token starts.
