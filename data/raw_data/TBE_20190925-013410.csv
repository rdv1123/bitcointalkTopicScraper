We are delighted to introduce our latest project TowerX, which will be developed alongside the existing products already mentioned in our road map.  The Pre-ICO ended on 04 June 2018 and it was dominated largely by private investors. We raised a total of $2.2 Million (soft cap was $2 Million).   Why TowerX?  We are an investor friendly company and we are happy to do what investors want us to do. The private investors who participated in Pre-ICO stage want us to build an exchange which includes the best features available on existing exchanges.  Accordingly, we will be using our existing technical know how and our data center infrastructure to build a reliable and secure exchange. Since, we are a SaaS company working with big data and coding is our core strength, we expect the exchange to be live much sooner than expected. However, for the record, we have kept the target date of launch of TowerX exchange in Q3 2018.  ICO on exchange  The TowerBee crowd sale will be on the TowerX exchange which will also mark the launch of the exchange. The TBE token will be listed on TowerX immediately after the crowd sale is over.  Airdrop when?  We have promised earlier that that 2.5 Million TBE tokens will be airdropped after ICO is over and before listing on exchange. We standby our words and the TBE tokens will be airdropped just after crowd sale is over on TowerX.  The TBE tokens will be unlocked only after the Airdrop has been done. So, everyone will have access to their TBE tokens before the trading begins on TowerX platform.

Below given are the declared rules of signature campaign for your quick reference.  ------------------------------------ Participants in this campaign have to be at least a Full Member to wear our signature. Minimum 15 constructive posts per week. If you don't reach 15 posts before a Sunday, you will not receive any stake for the current week. Posts made in the following sections (and all their child boards) will not be counted as valid posts: Marketplace; Off-topic; Archival; Marketplace (Altcoins). Posts such as ""hello"", ""good luck"", ""love this project"", or any other unsubstantial posts will not be counted as valid. Posts with less than 80 characters will not be counted as valid posts. Every signature campaign participant has to wear our avatar (except participants with Member rank). Participants with red trust score will not be accepted. Multiple accounts are not allowed and will result in banning you from our campaign. If you decide to leave us for another campaign, please write it down in this thread so we could check if you deserve to reserve your current week stakes (= if you posted 15 constructive posts). If you don't, we will not distribute your current week stakes.",False

Our project is a big step towards mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.  When individuals and companies would be able to buy SaaS products using cryptocurrencies for carrying out their everyday business, this will lead to mass adoption and will make cryptocurrencies even more popular. Needless to say, using TowerBee token to pay for the services will attract discounts on the list price.   One of our main services in our road-map is the cryptocurrency payment gateway which will accept 500+ crypto currencies with a single API. We will be charging the lowest transaction fee as we are able to distribute the overhead costs across our various other projects.  As of now we do not have a direct competitor in the Blockchain industry. Our competitors are yet to adopt the Blockchain technology.  Our competitors in traditional online industry vary according to the  services we offer. For example, for our CRM module, the competitors are Salesforce, Hubspot etc., for our E-Mail marketing module, the competitors are MailChimp, Sendgrid etc. By combining various projects under one roof we are able to give the same (and even better) service than our competitors at a much lower cost due to economies of scale.",False
