ICO is completed, we thank everyone who participated and supported us! While the ICO process, 2,146,346 ALTOCAR tokens were sold for $ 2,500,000 (as of November 10, 2017). Under the terms of the ICO, the softcap was $ 3,600,000. We remind you that under the terms of the ICO, the invested funds must be returned to the ICO participants. Also we remind that presale was successful in July-August with $ 300 000 equivalent in ALTOCAR tokens.  The reasons why the ICO did not take place in full power (in our opinion):  Most investors (by the way, members of the bounty campaign too) prefer to invest in tokens based on ETHEREUM, and not on WAVES We were in three forks (Bitcoin CASH, Bitcoin GOLD, Segwit2x). Many investors, including those with whom we regularly met, kept funds for this reason. Also, due to forks, bitcoin showed great growth in a short time. During this period, a large number of ICO came out and we simply disappeared in this mass Perhaps we did not fully communicate the essence of our project to the community In some moments, we were brought up by partners in advertising Many investors informed us that they are interested in purchasing tokens after the ICO from the exchanges  On ICO: Due to the fact that the soft-cap wasn't achieved, the funds will be returned to the ICO participants within 14 days (until 24.11.2017). We believe that this will be correct in relation to all participants.  On PRESALE: Since the presale passed successfully - the tokens will be transferred to the participants of the presale in full. Also, the presale participants will be subject to the conditions that were specified during the presale.   WE WORK FURTHER, MEET - PLAN ""B""!

ATTENTION TO THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE BOUNTY!  As the work on the service continues, we will have additional offers for participation. It will be necessary to distribute our news, we are ready to give tokens for this.  Our assumptions about the cost of the ALTOCAR token for the next 6 months:  In the first month / second month after the distribution of the tokens, we expect a drop in value, which is due to the fact that the tokens will be sold by the bounty campaign participants. Further, after the introduction of ALTOCAR tokens into the service economy, demand for it is expected to rise among the members of the AltoCar service itself.  From our side, we will make efforts to develop the ALTOCAR service and token. Stay in groups in telegram and social networks, we will share news on the project.

Having carried out additional financial analysis, we came to the conclusion that they made a mistake:  Running the service with an insufficient number of community members, holders of ALTOCAR tokens, we run the risk of not achieving the results indicated in White Paper, so we decided to increase the soft cap to $ 3.6 million. This soft cap will give us the opportunity to fully Start a service in 3 cities with a population higher 1 million people (at a rate of 1.2 million per city) and achieve all the necessary indicators.  Having launched 3 cities within 5 months after the end ICO we will get a huge demand for ALTOCAR tokens from ~ 100,000 people. Cities that we plan to fully launch in the first place: Kazan, Rostov-on-Don and Krasnodar (Russia). In the city data, our partner in drivers is already present and it is ready to be launched. We also intend to distribute the franchise in parallel.  ATTENTION! 1. If the soft store is not reached, the invested funds will be returned to the participants of the Crowdsale, in the currency in which the investment was made. 2. Tokens not realized at the time of crowdsale will be burned.  At the moment involved: More than $ 180,000 from more than 300 participants! Do not miss the chance to get tokens with an excellent bonus!  Tokens can be purchased for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Waves, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, Dash, ZCash.  Current Bonus 25%.  Join now!   ALTOCAR - The first global blockchain franchise personalized taxi After the completion of the ICO, it is planned to launch the franchise of the service and its promotion around the world. The franchise will be sold to any country, to any city in the world. Packing the franchise will take 2 months after the ICO, in parallel, pre-orders for it will be accepted.  The franchise can be purchased only for ALTOCAR tokens. Payment of royalty franchisees will be made only in ALTOCAR tokens. This will erase the borders between countries - it will not be necessary to conduct procedures with banks, currency transactions, etc. Pianos from the Franchisee will be paid almost instantly.  Franchisees will provide services to customers (transportation), pay drivers on a dual model - in ALTOCAR tokens and in a fiat.  Also, customers and service drivers will receive bonuses in ALTOCAR tokens after performing certain actions (reaching KPI, viewing advertising on trips, etc.).  Thanks to all the above, the service will receive explosive growth, the turnover of tokens will grow many times. As a result, a huge community of people using ALTOCAR tokens in everyday life will be formed.",False
