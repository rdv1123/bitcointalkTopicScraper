And admin did not know the answer. So she asked the team. I ask a few time more; no reply from the team and advice me to ask in the Telegram again. Also got no clear answer there! So i try here; and getting answers like: Not looking hard enough?  @ marinerpj; I think you are refering to chapter 8; ICO and Allocation of the Travelblock white paper; did you read it yourself?  The 20% TRVL program 120MN is not the team    Explain something about myself before anyone else jumps to an conclusion: I think Travel has a big potential with blockchain; that is why i put much effort & time into research different Travel blockchain project. Is also use different methodes like a part of Balina's fact figures like marketcap, soft cap and hard cap and also which % of the token go where. At this time i already invested in different Travel blockchains and now looking into if i need to put also some money on Travelblock. I have much patience; i can read my stuff but not getting my answers and comments like your doesn't make my journey easier:(  I'm looking a a few facts already softcap of 4.5million is honest; but the hardcap of $ 32.1million is a little bit much (just refering to Balina methode: https://youtu.be/ouO-1iLPKiE?t=7m31s and ofcourse if you compare them to other Travel blockchains)!",False

Really bullish on Travel Block, it will change the Travel Industry!   http://i64.tinypic.com/2hd0jft_th.jpg  OTA's (Online Travel Agents) have dominated the market for over 20 years giving consumers headaches for years by attaching hidden fees, giving you a false sense of savings where there really is none due to the OTA agreements that are in place to make sure these companies can never compete against each other, and the use of predictive analytics to boost rates on your vacation based on how many times you search for a specific flight or click on a link. TravelBlock will fix these problems to make sure the consumer will save time and money on your next trip. No Hidden Fees  TravelBlock will not have the user pay any hidden fees such as processing and cancellation. Private Consumer Group  Our TRVL token allows us to become a Closed Consumer Group so we can negotiate far better rates than any OTA on the market today by 30% - 60%. No price gouging  Shady algorithms that track your clicks and searches so OTAs can raise the price on you based on your interest will not happen at TravelBlock.",False

A lot of the other ICOs are just promising to do something faster or whatever, but can anyone really understand what the tech is going to be used for? I read about the SEC meeting that was going on yesterday and they were discussing in detail all the reasons for tokens to be needed and what would constitute a security and a utility moving forward, and one of the replies from a lady on the panel was that if it was too difficult to understand the token use, and/or the technologies role in the platform after reading the whitepaper then you should consider it a security and avoid it unless you know exactly how things work. TravelBlock is EASY as anything could be to understand, it ticks the biggest box for me on that front, which means if the SEC do come cracking down on people a bit, this one is going to be super safe, a lot of real life funds are going to pour into this if the travel industry itself is anything to go by too. Just barely contain my excitement for this, as i am gonna get a much needed vacation! :-D",False

According to my research they are first movers. So why do I want a decentralized Expedia - what kind of value can this add?  With TravelBlock we get one step closer to mainstream adoption as we in this case would use crypto to pay for our travels. In addition, the team estimate an average of 30 to 60% discount on the travels. An added bonus is the fact that for every 5 ETH, you receive one free week of vacation.

As a cryptocurrency Youtuber I've reviewed and worked with many ICOs in 2017, for most of them I just got a reward in terms of token payments (whether that was BTC/ETH/VIBE/IDH/Spectre/etc.). What other ICO gives you complimentary stuff on top of your tokens? If there are any others, they are far and few. You get a free week of vacation for your 5 ether.  Now that sounds cool and all, but the thing that makes TravelBlock stand out from the rest is that it's going towards a niche that nobody has really done before yet. Travel? Tourism? That's an annual contribution of $2.3 TRILLION! Crazy. Expedia alone spent over $218.3M on US Television advertisements in 2015! Since that year they've shifted a lot more attention towards the internet, and now everybody's expressed interest in blockchain technology yet so few companies have actually done ANYTHING about it.  Most ICOs out there want to raise money to build the platform and the connections and the team. TravelBlock's got that. Boom. So what's the capital needed for? To expand the platform, bulk purchase more destinations, better secure the current alpha-version of our working platform and get it into beta for the public, marketing and to set ourselves up to become the replacement for OTA's. As far as I know, there's nobody else out there right now with all the working pieces together. Maybe parts.. but we're already a few steps ahead.

It's low cost, pseudonymous, secure, immutable, irreversible and transparent for the public. But for those who aren't ready for the blockchain, well that's fine.. we accept FIAT currency too. It's TRULY an all-in-one. Would it be that if it was only FIAT? Why not both? ",False

If TravelBlock is going to cause some travel industry disruption with lower fees, better trips, better service etc I think an example could be provided (for those that can't make the show) of what that disruption will be. You could maybe show an example of a $5k family vacation with the big websites and then show the same vacation on the Travelblock website and how it could save the customer money.  If you were on Shark Tank (Dragon's Den) pitching this idea ... this is a question that they would want answered.   The best of luck to everyone involved.   ",False
