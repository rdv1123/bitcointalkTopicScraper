The FIFA World Cup has been giving and still continues to give unforgettable emotions to the whole world. However, today we would like to draw attention to the other side of this event.  Sex with foreigners is currently the most discussed topic. Russian females, who have been closely communicating with foreign fans, have caused a huge criticism from other Russians who accuse them of improper behavior. Other people, on the contrary, support a woman’s right to have intimate relationships with foreigners. State Duma deputies, popular public figures and bloggers actively discuss this topic; social networks are full of memes and sharp jokes about international relationships.  Love is a beautiful thing. We are very happy about international couples formed during World Cup period. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that any event in such scale increases the number of single mothers who give birth to a child after having a close contact with a foreigner. We will not close our eyes on it; thus, we are going to help women who become single mothers after the World Cup 2018.

On current stage of development we introduce you Beta version of Membrana platform, available on the link below:  Beta - https://beta.membrana.io     Objective  The main objective of Membrana platform is to directly connect an investor and a trader to conclude a mutually beneficial, secure, and reliable contract.  To avoid risks for an investor and a trader, such as fraud, lack of trust and other counterparty risks and to make cooperation under trust management more profitable and safe, here at Membrana we have developed a unique algorithm which provide users such opportunities:  Membrana platform allows an investor to give traders an opportunity to manage funds, but not possessing the funds. Also, investors do not transfer their funds to Membrana platform Traders get access for trading through unique interface, which works with exchanges through API protocol. Investor set all the restrictions for this key, including which cryptocurrencies are available for trading.  All parameters of the deal, such as target profit, duration of the contract, maximum trading loss, etc are deployed in Ethereum smart contract, which controls granting an access for trading and holds trader’s commission fee to the time contract is finished. Rating system is integrated in Membrana platform, where all traders and investors are ranked by their finished contracts and ROI (return of investment). Investors can easily choose suitable trader, based on complete and definitive information about his achievements. Users can be sure of getting reliable data on past activities, because it is confirmed by a hash sum of transactions saved in blockchain.
