Filippo Marcassoli: Marcassoli was a marketing specialist at Roche Diagnostics, a healthcare company based in Basel. Luca Del Torchio: Before joining Safilo, an eyewear company, Del Torchio has worked as a consultant at Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Vittorio Ferrari: Ferrari, a former marketing director at Bonduelle, has worked for Olivetti and Kodak.  Advisors Alvise Saccomani: Saccomani is the head of trading at BANOR, an Italian investment firm. Sebastiano Cappa: Cappa is a member of the board of directors at IAB Europe. Previously he was the head of the Italian branch at SmartFocus, a computer software company based in London.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of FidelityHouse.  Risks     Bonuses provided to private sale and pre-sale contributors are a bit high. (-1.5)     The token appeals to a very niche audience, namely FidelityHouse platform users. (-1.5)  Growth Potential     The project is live since 2011 and has gained serious community interest: 63 million page views, 400 million impressions, 200 million unique visitors and 10 million videos viewed per month in Italy. (+3.5)     The platform is able to support any content through its lifecycle while enabling the content creator to monetize his or her efforts. Hashing and timestamping is sufficient to prove any content’s original ownership. (+2.5)     There is not much competition for similar projects within the blockchain sphere. (+1)  Disposition In many content sharing platforms, their respective creators do not get paid and it is the platform owners who actually make money. FidelityHouse enables these content creators to monetize their efforts and to prove that they are the original creators of the content. Although this is a quite important problem in the digital intellectual properties industry and the use of blockchain almost perfectly fits the goal, surprisingly there is not much competition. The project has been around since 2011 and already has seen great interest, thus an audience already exists. Still, bonuses provided to private sale and pre-sale investors are a bit high, so the ICO investor should be wary. Also, the token’s usage is restricted to the platform and thus a very niche audience, which means that if the project does not attract content creators, low demand for the token can be expected. FidelityHouse receives a 4/10.
