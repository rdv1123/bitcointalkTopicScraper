Thank you for your questions, rather reasonable! The price of tokens is determined and published on the website on the date of distribution of the tokens. How is it calculated: recalculated to the Ethereum in accordance with the rates on the date of payment, the payments are multiplied by the total bonus factors. These values are summed up, resulting in a calculated amount of received Ethereum with the bonuses taken into account. This calculated amount is divided into 500 million tokens and the base price of the token in Ethereum is obtained. The number of tokens received by the Buyer is calculated as the sum of the money paid by him, exchanged into Etherium and multiplied by the final bonus factor and divided by the base price of the token. The resulting value is rounded to an integer. The total amount sold can vary slightly from 500 million due to rounding discrepancy.  As you understand from the above, we can't tell you right now, how many tokens you will get after ICO if you invest $600 now, the amount depends on many factors. What we can say for sure is that the token price is to grow after ICO and ensure the investment profit (please check our terms and conditions and you will find there the forecast of the token price growth)/ ThX",False

The world’s first Free Crypto Economic Zone (FCEZ) established in a state with the most favorable business conditions. FreeZone is:   A free economic zone created especially for blockchain-based business and cryptocurrency operations. Within this zone, blockchain business can operate legally, protected from persecution by external governments and regulatory agencies, and free from income tax and tax on cryptocurrency transactions. An infrastructure aimed to drastically simplify the running of business and operations involving cryptocurrencies for both companies and individuals within the FCEZ (Free Crypto Economic Zone), while also offering services to foreign entities. This infrastructure is made up of 5 main enterprises: a universal trading platform (UTP), a payment system, a bank, an investment bank, and a marketing agency, all of which will work with both cryptocurrencies and fiat money. A blockchain community. Part of FreeZone’s own profits will be allocated to developing programs for this community with libertarian ideals. We plan to provide services for free or at cost, including education; assistance in obtaining citizenship; asset protection via blockchain technology; legal assistance, human rights protection; and much more. Moreover, we plan to create business opportunities for community members. This unique blend of corporation and community will ensure a perfect synergy, with each one helping the other grow.   The Whitepapers:  The Whitepaper (EN)   FreeZone Video:    Token Sale Details  We are planning to attract $100 million to finance the project through the creation and sale of FreeZone tokens. Token Sale will start in March 2018 and will run for 28 days. The tokens will be created based on Ethereum standard ERC-20.  The total amount of the tokens to be issued is 1 billion. 500 million tokens will be sold during the ICO, whilst 200 million tokens are to be held by FreeZone Corp. and will be used to support the ecosystem, bounty-program, and project promotion, as well as for the secondary placement. 300 million tokens will be gradually transferred into the possession of the project’s founders. The first 100 million tokens will become their property 12 months after the ICO. Subsequently, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after the ICO is finished, 50 million tokens for each 6 month period will be transferred into their possession.  The issuance of FreeZone tokens takes place only once and amounts to 1 billion tokens. No further tokens will be issued. No less than 50% of FreeZone Corp. net profit will be divided among FreeZone token holders. The services provided by FreeZone can be paid for with tokens. The development path of the blockchain community and the social services it provides will be defined by a system of voting, and the number of votes of one project participant can exercise will equal the number of tokens they hold.  The tokens held by FreeZone Corp. and the tokens that are gradually transferred into possession of the project founders following the ICO completion date form part of the profit distribution and voting on the same terms as the rest of the tokens.    Token Allocation  When it comes to token allocation, the following applies:  The total amount of the tokens to be issued is 1 billion. 500 million tokens will be sold during the ICO. 200 million tokens are to be held by FreeZone Corp. 300 million tokens will be gradually transferred into the possession of the project’s founders.  Use of proceeds from the token sale will be arranged the following way:   The share amounts in the use of proceeds are fixed proportions where the ICO is successful (if the sale target is achieved or close to that). In case the amount of capital raised is less than $100 million, the budget distribution will take place based on the actually achieved level of the project (milestones) development achieved in accordance with the figures below:    Bonuses and Bounty  Customers can receive 3 types of bonuses:  Early registration bonus Early payment bonus Referral program participation bonus  The bonus coefficient for early registration is 1.05. This bonus is guaranteed for customers, who register for private accounts and provide the necessary personal data before the ICO start date and while early registration is open.  The bonus coefficient for the early payment is calculated as follows:   The project’s referral program is described on the project’s official website. The final bonus coefficient for customers is calculated by multiplying together all the bonus coefficients that the customers have.
