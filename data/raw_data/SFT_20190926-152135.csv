However I was under the impression the project is genuine; maybe not as successful as they expected it to be, but at least they tried to build something. Now I have serious concerns though. Kicking people out for a couple of genuine questions, is somewhat ridiculous.  My questions were the following, I'll try to ask here, just in case if someone could answer them, or ask again in Telegram, maybe in a better way than I did:   ""It looks like Carl Kirchhoff has left the project recently. Is it correct? Who is leading the project now? Is the project still alive or is it abandoned? What are the plans?""  Those questions were enough to kick me out of the channel...

Isaiah Jones: Jones has worked at Google and Rocket Internet SE. Ganesh Nathan: Before his time as a senior football executive at the Asian Football Confederation, Nathan has worked at PwC and KPMG. Ravi Teja: Teja is a former software developer at Tech Mahindra and a former game developer at Gameloft.  Advisors Michael Terpin: Terpin was the founder and the CEO of MarketWire, a public relations company, later sold to CCN Matthews for $35 million. Phil Lines: Lines has worked as the director of international broadcasting and media operations at The Premier League. Michael Payne: Before becoming Bernie Ecclestone’s special advisor, Payne was the head of marketing at International Olympic Committee.  Partners Total Sports Asia: TSA is a sports content and branding company focusing on Asia.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of SportsFix.  Risks     The success of the project is highly dependent on negotiations with sports channels and clubs, which is not easy. (-1.5)     If an amount considerably less than the hard cap is reached, it might turn out to be extremely hard for the team to provide access for major sports games which might immensely reduce the overall interest in the platform. (-1.5)  Growth Potential     60% of token sale proceeds will be allocated to acquire and create sports content. (+2.5)     The team and advisors have enormous experience in sports marketing and broadcasting. (+3.5)     High community interest, e.g. Telegram group has over 30k members as of writing and is very active with members posting a lot of messages. (+2)  Disposition The traditional sports broadcasting companies require sports fans to pay great amounts to gain access to their services. These are usually presented as standard packages, including channels and games that a sports fan most probably will not bother watching. A considerable percentage of this goes to middlemen as well. SportsFix provides a much cheaper alternative with better services. Backed by an immensely experienced team and advisors, and a company already providing such services, the project has a good chance to achieve its goals. As a wide range of sports content is of utmost importance for the success of the project any failure in negotiations with sports clubs and major broadcasting companies includes great risk if the team does not have sufficient funds in the case of not meeting the hard-cap, yet considering high community interest it seems quite likely that they will be able to reach it. It will be also possible to pay by fiat currency to have access to single games, which should increase the rate of adoption for a service which is much needed. Overall the project is truly promising, though high discounts between 30% and 50% should be a concern for the ICO investor. As the public pre-sale is still ongoing, people planning to invest should hurry and not miss out on discounted tokens. SportsFix receives a 5/10.
