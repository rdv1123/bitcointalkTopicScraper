Right now the issue with Crypto is use case and without that cryptocurrency will never see mass adoption.   How Blockchain Technology Can Revolutionize Our Industry  Blockchain technology represents a paradigm shift for the Internet of Things. It is already being dubbed as Web 3.0 by tech pioneers. Over the past couple of years, it has demonstrated its potential for wide-scale adoption, especially in industries that put security, authenticity, and Transparency at their core. At the same time, it has effectively accomplished something that has never been done before in human history, creating a trustless digital economy with no centralized authority or intermediaries.  Blockchain technology offers the technological tools necessary to confront the primary challenges faced by the premium goods and services industry.  Ensuring the authenticity of products: The premium segment is threatened by counterfeiting and incurs multiple losses worth millions of dollars globally. Using blockchain technology, it is possible to document every single detail of the product including its origin or manufacturing details, transit information, previous ownership history, and other sensitive information which is otherwise not available through regular retailers.  Creating a trustless financial environment without intermediaries: There is a lot of ambiguity when defining a trustless financial environment, especially with blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies distribute the centralized control, otherwise witnessed in the traditional financial institutions, among multiple players within the network. These network players validate the authenticity of money and the financial transaction, eliminating the need for any financial institution. Instant financial transactions: An average international wire transfer request takes between 2 to 5 days to reach the recipient’s account, and in turn, lengthens the overall processing time frame. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, take less than a fraction of a second to reach the recipient’s account. Using cryptocurrencies for premium purchases, or any other business will expedite the entire business transaction.  Devising an advance shipment tracking strategy: Using smart contracts provisioned in blockchain technology, it is possible to track every single movement in a supply chain and update the details in real time. Providing access to a mobile application to input these details to all the parties involved in a transaction could offer end-to-end coverage. Some technology firms and startups have initiated smart shipment tracking projects using blockchain technology. The alliance between IBM and Maersk is an indication of the growing interest in the implementation of blockchain technology in transportation.  Lower processing periods: An online ecosystem running on blockchain could significantly shorten the overall transaction period for all purchases. Using blockchain for payments, shipment tracking, and maintaining accounting or business documents is a decisive strategy for any commercial ecosystem.  Automating multiple tasks through smart contracts: A regular e- commerce product transaction, either sale or purchase, involves numerous  steps and requires a significant amount of time and efforts for completion. The Smart Contract feature of Ethereum blockchain, or similar functionality available in other blockchains, can automate a majority of these tasks, especially ones that do not require human intervention. The overall system becomes much more efficient and cost-effective. Ensuring platform security and integrity: Businesses lost close to $400 billion to cyber hacking in 2015, and these figures continue to grow with most of the businesses digitizing their operations.  The blockchain technology is an answer to these cyber threats. Blockchain platforms use cryptography, which is a potent barrier against cyber attacks. Furthermore, blockchains use personal and private keys for operation, which makes them virtually impassable for hackers. The decentralized nature of blockchains adds another layer of security against cyber threats, making it immune to targeted attacks.",False
