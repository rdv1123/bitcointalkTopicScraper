Companies we are stating on the website are our clients (like Coca-Cola) so there won't be any official statement on their part, we will do our best to deliver sufficient materials in regards to that soon, but proving a client is actually more difficult than a partner. However you can be very sure, that if we were claiming such things without them being true, Coca-Cola would sue our asses and since we have had it on our website for months, they would have already noticed a long time ago. It's a big company, so they use many solutions for many different things and just like they might be using AT&T, Orange or T-Mobile as a company phone provider they won't go around telling it to everybody, they really have better things to do than to keep tweeting what product their company is using for x and y.  As for the technology & solutions partners, we have already provided sufficient proof of partnership with GEMA MEA (you can also check it on their website) and we will soon be releasing announcements with proofs of partnerships with more of our partners. Although big brand names like Coca-Cola sound impressive and we are proud they have chosen to use our solution, it is the technology partners that will be helping us turning our vision into reality and those that actually matter the most when it comes to our project.

We are convinced these changes will be accepted with enthusiasm, particularly by contributors.  These changes come as a result of an extensive discussion that took place in the entire team along with our experienced advisors and we are confident that implementation of such adjustments is beneficial to everyone involved.  1. The TGE (Token Generation Event) will take place on March 26, 2018. Reasons for such decision are:  A. Strategic Partnerships — Not only have we achieved to acquire new and strong business and development partnerships, but we have also agreed on an improved strategy with our existing partners. We will disclose all the details in the coming weeks as a part of our brand marketing strategy.  B. Registration in Georgia — We have taken time to establish a new subsidiary company in Georgia from which we will operate the TGE. You as an experienced investor are surely aware that Georgia is the new and coming country friendly to the crypto universum.  C. GIF & Compliance Auditing — We have extended our legal and compliance team with international experts that are tirelessly working on our project in order to meet all the legal requirements now being imposed on TGEs.  2. Decreased Hard cap  To better reflect and optimize GIF token long vision strategy, SOCIFI team, advisors and influencers agreed on adjustments of the GIF Token metrics. The Hard Cap for SOCIFI TGE is to be 26,127,734 USD. This cap is fundamentally derived from the budget we intend to use to purchase bulks of mobile data. We are an established company, with a working product and an already existing base of customers we really want to raise just the funds that we really need for our business to expand and not a penny more. The difference of approximately 21 million USD is constituted by the amount of money we know we would have needed to purchase mobile data in the USA and Russia (see section 9.3.1 of our White Paper). USA & Russian LTE markets will be penetrated in the next stages, we will pursue a phase approach.  3. GIF tranches & bonuses  Based on solid feedback from the market, we have decided to offer GIF tokens in Crowdsale without bonuses. Due to both the increased demand on GIF tokens (despite the market situation) and optimized Hard Cap we have decided to simplify the GIF-offering process.  A. Presale In order to protect our Crowdsale contributors we had to carefully choose our pre-sale investors and limit the presale cap. Presale hard cap is to be in the amount of 6.4 million USD Discount in the presale phase is 35% and tokens will be locked for 6 months. We are grateful for the confidence our presale investors expressed by agreeing on lock-up period of 6 months.  B. Crowdsale Due to decreased Hard Cap and increased demand for GIF tokens we simplified Crowdsale into one stage.  Conclusion  You can expect several new announcements very soon and we are convinced you will like them. Stay tuned, we’ll back with them shortly. Meanwhile, see what Rockaway Capital, our investment partner, says about SOCIFI TGE at https://youtu.be/LftxDnHNic0. More interviews coming soon. A message from CEO. “First of all, I’m excited to implement the new strategy into SOCIFI TGE (Token Generation Event). Such changes help us to fulfill our mission and be one of the best TGEs. However, furthermore I’m thrilled of positive responses we are getting from you, crypto community. I want to personally thank you for your support and shared vision. Big thanks go to all SOCIFI team members and advisors.”  Sidney Z Hornych, CEO & SOCIFI Team",False

There have been many questions here, I will try to answer some of them, those I did not, I encourage you to ask them again in our Telegram channel, where we are available almost 24/7. https://t.me/joinchat/GsR_DUm_PvPNevdthIeCgw  As to the questions:  - Sponsors will be paying for the data, either by buying GIF directly or paying in fiat (which large brands will likely do, at least at first) for which we will buy GIF in equivalent value and distribute it to the network of data market place. This process will eventually become automated and decentralized (see the WP for more details). We offer more products - you can visit our company website https://www.socifi.com/ and see what services we offer, but most interesting at this moment are sponsored data and wifi monetization platform. By interacting with the sponsored content you earn GIF, which you can then exchange for free data or product/services offered by sponsors.  Different people have different needs, of course some people have their own internet connection bundles and would likely not use our service (or at least not on regular basis), but for many people data are either un-affordable or simply they prefer to have them free. You get to chose your own preferred bands of which content you want to interact with, so they will not be regular annoying ads. Either way this model works really well for free mobile games and many people will appreciate such model especially people from developing countries, children or anyone from a country with expensive data.  - An important part of our strategy is connecting with strong partners, so we are capable of realizing such ambitious vision. As mentioned TATA Communications is one of the strongest telecom companies in the world and they do play crucial part in the deployment. The same with GEMA MEA, who is likewise a telco heavy weight and will play crucial role in our roadmap plan for Africa and Middle East, together with a few other partners yet to be announced. You can see a letter of reference from GEMA MEA together with an article from their CEO we have shared on our Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/giftoken/comments/7r424z/partnership_with_gema_mea_is_crucial_to/.  Thank you for you interest in our bounty campaign, there have been some internal matters that delayed a certain part of the campaign, however translation campaign is already booked out. For more information please visit our Telegram Bounty channel: https://t.me/joinchat/GgLrM0enSf6smiZ7uirIWA , the bounty itself is poste here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2758875.0  As for Android app, it is already in development, you can check out the test app available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B16wHRja8doNQUlsSUVfT1pMZjA/view  If you have more questions, please ask away, either here or on Telegram.
