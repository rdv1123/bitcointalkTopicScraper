The first testers have already submitted their first feedbacks, the dev team continues their work considering the comments received, so we decided to say a little about the platform in this article.  For the beginning we must to say that the BMCHAIN platform was created on the basis of existing platform named steemit. However, while the development process and with the operating results of the other platform named platform.molodost.bz it became clear that the code must be rewritten to implement all the features planned. In particular, the changes were made in the blockchain`s core. For example, content downloading speed were increased, and compatibility for new design and functionality were added. But the client application had to be completely rewritten. The new client application was determined by several factors, both because the steemit client is quite complicated and with a lack of documentation for its working process, and because the team wanted not only to expand the capabilities of the BMCHAIN platform compared to original steemit, but to create a new unique design. The Angular 2.0 framework from Google were choose for client application development. Later it was gradually moved to the updated Angular version 4.0, and recently started the transition on the fifth version, which update was released on November,1 this year. On assurances of developers, all of this helped to create a more flexible client, that becomes easy respond to users requests and wishes. The increasingly popular technology of SPA (Single Page Application) was also implemented, which will help to reduce the load of servers and simplify user`s working with the page because of the most of the necessary code is loading along with the page when first loaded, thereby reducing subsequent requests to the server, and expanding the capabilities of the page viewing in the browser.  Further work with the platform assumes a series of load tests on its functionality. The original purpose of the audit is to find the boundaries, the maximum value for the number of simultaneous connections per time, to guarantee a stable work of the platform for users. Due to results of the tests a new changes in the configuration of the generation rate or the size of the blocks in the blockchain might be done, with the aim of improving the reliability or the downloading speed of the platform.",True

CryptoInvestForum report .  This is the question that was highlighted by the co-founder of the BMCHAIN platform Roman Moiseyev within the First Practical Conference of the participants of the digital financial market CryptoInvestForum.  We all know about Bitcoin and other altcoins which are implemented with the blockchain and increase their capitalization on a daily basis. But they also have a significant disadvantage for money — a constantly growing price deprives the owners of the incentive to spend coins, forcing, on the contrary, to accumulate them as much as possible.  Roman Moiseyev pointed out in his speech that now only the blockchain application that will be the first to overcome this and some other shortcomings of the cryptocurrency, while making a profit, will succeed. In this regard, we are now working with the BM company on the BMCHAIN project. It is intended to become a pilot site, where we will try to create a model for the first time, where tokens will be profitable to spend. To do this, all conditions are created: the price for any product or service in tokens will be lower, they can be conveniently paid using a mobile phone, they can be not only bought, but also earned on the platform, providing its usefulness to other users. Well, the cost of the token will be regulated both by the activity of the users themselves, and by the complexity factor to avoid excessive emissions. Thus, the increase in demand will give rise to the token price, and it will be advantageous for sellers to give a discount today to earn on this growth, and buyers will be motivated to purchase for tokens due to a lower price. Pay with tokens will also be beneficial, as well as accepting them!  Now, when legal procedures that will allow you to change tokens for goods and services are ending, you can also leave a request to support@bmchain.io and become our partner in order to be one of the first to accept tokens for your goods and services!",True

Creating its ecosystem based on the BMCHAIN platform, we do not forget about the need for BMT token to be listed on exchanges. Particular attention nowadays is increasingly attracted by decentralized exchanges, which provide a higher level of security for its users, both from fraudsters and from state authorities, and political games.   Today we want to introduce a new platform partner - a decentralized DEEX exchange of the new generation. This project will combine the latest ideas for modern cryptoexchange markets with the prospect of reaching the level of a global financial ecosystem that blurs the line between traditional and digital trading.   Among the advantages of the DEEX project will be not only high transaction security provided by the decentralized nature of the system, but also high performance - up to 100,000 transactions per second, and convenience for corporate use. The exchange strives to become the most convenient for a wide range of users, for which simple mechanisms will be created for integration with third-party services and special cryptocurrency debit cards that can be used in the ATM network with instant conversion to Fiat. And for large companies, special accounts will be implemented with the possibility of access from several individual user accounts.   Within the DEEX and BMCHAIN cooperation, project tokens will be used to reward participants of the system, guaranteeing them an excellent investment perspective. Agreements were reached on the mutual inclusion of project participants in the teams of consultants, which will allow both sides to gain invaluable experience in sharing knowledge in the development and promotion of their sites.

Moreover, the token rate against Bitcoin changed to 0.000005 BTC or 66.67%! Prior to this, since December 2, the rate was fixed at 0.000002 BTC, and began its growth from the beginning of this year to the mark of 0.000003 BTC. At the time of writing the post only 12460 BMT were for sale at this price on HitBTC.com — that is quite a bit before the next rate increase.  All this affected the trading volume on the first post-holiday day — they grew at once several times! At the same time, the basis of trading volume is against Bitcoin — 78%. In general, over the past 24 hours, the volume of trading increased by 300% (ETH) and 500% (BTC), and still continues to grow!  Full details are available on cryptocompare.  Against the backdrop of this news, we also add that our team continues to negotiate with coinmarketcap.com so that even more investors can get acquainted and join our project.

Running the first stage of beta testing of the future platform two months ahead of schedule, the developer team isn’t going to slow down the pace. And while the next patch of the test platform is being prepared, work on longer-term tasks is being done.  One of them is the implementation of the closed content placement service in the posts. In the future it’ll become that part of the system that helps users expand the scope of the token use. That is, the user of the platform won’t be limited to earnings only by clicking “likes”. Thanks to the closed content service, you can insert a text section into the post, which other users can only open after payment to the author. For example, some insider information or a link can be closed. At the moment, the technical part of this function is almost finished, but it won’t reach the test client before February-March.  The next service, which is being prepared by the developers, — the ability to send users personal messages through the platform. This function was already provided in the Steemit kernel, but the final implementation wasn’t completed and required further development.  For the convenience of a large customer number, BM is working on an application to simplify the purchase of tokens for fiat. Precise mechanics are only just being developed, but the main goal is to create a site, that will make the process of tokens purchasing will be easier and faster, literally, in a few clicks. Moreover, an additional issue won’t be launched for the site — if the allocated reserve is completed in the process of work, additional volume will be purchased on the exchange.  One more area of work outside the platform is worth noting— a game for mobile phones. At the end of December, the game concept with the use of the BMT token was developed, the participants of which will not only compete with each other, but will also have the opportunity to exchange the winning for valuable prizes at a special cost!

Now it's impossible to imagine modern life without social networking. It is where we communicate with each other, find groups of interest, buy and sell things, do business. And there are many different websites for it, so what distinguishes have BMCHAIN from others?  To answer this question, at first we will try to describe what we usually do in social network? For example, while watching the news you may see a very informative post and click Like. Then author receive your gratitude, but that’s all. Or we can complement the author's thought with the comment under the post, or even refute the original text with it. All of this affects only to the abstract reputation of the author and the commentators.  But for the monetization of his authority, the author will be forced to publish promotional articles paid by the advertiser, which may disappoint some of his followers. At the same time in next generation networks, which include BMCHAIN, every Like or a comment will give some value for the author. So the good author is able to monetize his usefulness, getting benefits from being interesting and useful to others.  Also the new model of social networks contains a visual representation of the ""reputation"" of the author. And BMCHAIN also stands out for its new scheme of assessment of reputation, which will not depend directly on the amount of bonuses earned (or purchased on the stock exchange) by the user. With every action your reputation will grow, and the higher it is, the more bonus tokens you will receive. Suggest your usefulness to other members of the system, write interesting articles, work instructions, business plans, share valuable experience, implement it efficiently and get an assessment of your work, which consists of the reputation of voting members.  In the future people will be able to choose the best qualified and conscientious executive and to seek the services of a particular company on the base of reputation.  The implementation based on the popular nowadays BLOCKCHAIN technology makes the accrual of reputation and bonuses absolutely open and transparent and the whole system in general both economically and technically decentralized.

Russian Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Viktor Evtukhov pointed out that “it is often the case that the information about the forest resources licenced to industrial businesses is not adequate or complete, so businesses may face financial losses. Unfortunately, Russian forest resources are sometimes used in a predatory way or even smuggled away from Russia. With the modern technology like blockchain, we will be able to prevent potential abuse and foster the legal timber industry business growth.”  VEB Chairman Sergey Gorkov stressed that the project idea was generated and prepared for being implemented by schoolchildren from the VEB Teenager Involvement team. “This pilot project proves that our understanding was right that teenagers can deal with daunting tasks just as well as adults. They have little experience, but this is strength rather than a weakness. Nothing is holding them back, and they are upbeat, enthusiastic and determined to reach their goals. And though their projects need to be refined, it is obvious that they have the potential for evolving into effective business applications. The forest resource soundness monitoring project outcomes will be really useful to businesses and industrial companies in the forestry and timber industry and construction sector. Also, it will be a useful asset to people and businesses covered under the Far East Hectare programme.  During the trial implementation phase, the pilot project will be implemented at the assets of VEB subsidiary Kraslesinvest, a major timber processing facility in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. If the trial launch of the project is successful, the new forest resource monitoring system will be used in other Russia’s areas and regions.  The project trial phase will commence in November and will be finalised before the end of 2017. The field testing and preparation for scaling up the project are planned to be carried out in February 2018. The software developer for the project is Analytica Insight, a Russian company based in Chelyabinsk and winner of the Kazan nation-wide hackathon co-sponsored by VEB. Analytica Insight chief executive Roman Moiseyev acted as mentor for the teenaged designer team. He noted that “while the product prototype is tested by addressing actual objectives that Kraslesinvest needs to solve, we will have not only to find an optimum database architecture solution, but also to explore the economic benefits and cost impact of blockchain technology as alternative to the tools for forest resource soundness monitoring that are currently being used. It is needless to say that the young designers from the VEB Teenager Involvement Department, who created the base system prototype, will be a part of the designer team. This team of young people have proved to be really passionate about creating software and exploring the new ways of doing things. The young designers will develop software and act as analysts according to the product map. They will continue to search for the potential markets for the products and new project partners.”  Source: http://www.veb.ru/en/press/news/?id_19=104302",True

Here is another story:   ""My name is Pavel, I'm the co-founder of the Kinokwest company with a share of 50%.  2014 was a year of great changes for me. In November, my best friend and I rented our first room for this company. I consider this moment as a key one - this is a real transition from a plan to a global action.  When our ""product"" was almost ready for sale to the consumer, we seriously thought: how can we sell it? It's ridiculous to remember, but we were sure that we would make it cool and there wouldn't be any problem with sales.  The reality turned out to be different.  We didn't have money for advertising, and it was necessary to take loans for advertising, and this was a very risky action - it was necessary to study the advertising tools in detail.  I assembled the site from some template, in just a couple of days, it was a quick fix. My friend found a reservation system, we put it on the site so that users could choose a free time. I put all this on the Internet.  Now we have 6 quest rooms in 3 locations in Moscow + hookah Teslalounge, made in the techno-style, and we do not want to stop there. Every day, actions are taken to develop the company. Soon we will launch the virtual reality direction and will build our quests in other regions.  At the end of my story I want to express my opinion about BMCHAIN and BMT token. This is a very cool project! I have already purchased BMT at the start (pre-ICO) and follow the news now.

In order to simplify and optimize the token distribution model, the duration of the project’s ICO is reduced to 30 days with the end of tokensale on October 10, 2017. Besides, the cost of token together with the discount for each of the periods becomes fixed.        A high degree of involvement in the project of one of the biggest business community as well as more advanced system for evaluating users’ actions based on digital reputation, indicate that the active audience of a new platform is more likely to exceed the Golos project audience with the capitalization reaching $100,000,000. The comparative analysis has been made on the examples of the projects with a similar working model — Golos and Steem, whose capitalizations currently comprise about $17,000,000 and $250,000,000 respectively.    According to the activity of the Golos audience it’s obvious that only 1200 –1600 active loyal users create a capitalization of about $17.000.000. This means that every active user creates about $10,000 of capitalization.  This indicator allows estimating the approximate capitalization of the BMCHAIN project with at least active involvement of the BM audience in the amount of 50,000 people. Even taking into account the amount of capitalization per person is 5 times less than in Golos, the total capitalization of the platform will be more than $100,000,000. These indicators will grow in proportion to the growth in the number of external users and partners around the world.  Further Plans  The developers plan to release the first version of the platform before the end of the year. The created functional will allow any participant of the system to receive tokens for every useful action and start forming their digital reputation by means of exchanging useful knowledge, experience, materials with participants around the world.  BMT token is expected to appear on exchanges in September — October 2017.  All preICO participants will receive their tokens already on September 10th according to the price given above.   ►Visit BMCHAIN website◄",True

Each participant of the system can convert the accumulated knowledge and experience into a digital property with the possibility of using it to purchase goods and services in everyday life. An econometric model of the system was developed on the Biznes Molodost audience, the largest business community of Russia and the CIS, which will make it possible to take all the advantages of Blockchain technologies.  The implemented functionality will allow thousands of people and entrepreneurs to share their experience, resources, capabilities and knowledge by writing posts, voting and commenting, thus getting a real value expressed in digital tokens of the system, easily convertible into other types of digital property and fiat currencies. Rewards can be received not only by the participants who demonstrate useful activity, but also by those who estimate their contribution.   The main idea of the project is to measure, preserve and monetize the value (benefit) that arises in the process of communication between people and is expressed as a change in the reputation coefficient. Keeping the information about communication and monitoring the change in productivity, it is possible to effectively evaluate each participant's potential value for the system and its members, which can be expressed by the reputation coefficient. Reputation is used as the main multiplier determining the size of the reward received by the user from the system and its participants.  Biznes Molodost community includes thousands of successful entrepreneurs providing a large number of goods and services which are demanded by real people and can be obtained in exchange for BMT tokens.  An additional possibility of the BMCHAIN platform  or any business will be the opportunity to create its own Blockchain-application with the necessary logic based on the developed TokenAPI solution without the need to study the technical level of Blockchain.  The partner accepting tokens for the payment is offered the automated possibility of conversion of the tokens received into roubles. To accept tokens the system participant must provide users with a list of goods or services including a real discount of at least 20%. The reputation of the partner providing quality products or services in exchange for tokens starts growing along with the bonus tokens credited for the usage of the system and the number of partner's incoming and outgoing transactions. The amount of bonus tokens obtained when making transactions depends on the reputation of the user and the partner.  To get more details, please, visit our website.  The BMCHAIN project is an integrated system with its own infrastructure, social and economic mechanics, implemented with the help of blockchain technology. The central part of the system is BMCHAIN Core, which implements basic social and economic mechanics, stores information in the blockchain system and interacts with external systems through API.   The following BM services will be connected to the platform primarily:  BM Educational Platform - the BM software platform, where educational programs are conducted. Each participant has a personal account, through which he or she studies, performs tasks of the training course and analyzes the statistics of the progress.

BM Bullet - a simple and intuitive landing page designer, through which you can create high conversion sites in a couple of clicks. BM Radar - a mobile business contact application that organizes meetings using geolocation. TokenApi - a simple tool for creating your own token on the Ethereum blockchain platform  in 3 clicks.  More detailed information about the project terms and conditions is available on our website.  Digital reputation - the reputation of the BMCHAIN platform participant, expressed in its value for the system and its participants, which can be used to exchange it for services or money.   What is the digital reputation of a participant based on  Creation of unique useful materials (articles, posts, etc.) on the business topic on the content platform with payment depending on their rating and the author's reputation Implementation of collaborative projects between the participants Business contracts with a positive result (based on Smart Contract) Search and catalog delivery of contractors by the level of their digital reputation not depending on the size of the ad budget and the skill of the marketer Each member of the community is its investor Social activity (likes, comments, etc.) Assessing interacting with each other Payment of goods and services within the business community Purchase of Biznes Molodost products Exchange of contacts Answers to questions  Biznes Molodost community includes thousands of successful entrepreneurs providing a large number of goods and services which are demanded by real people and can be obtained in exchange for BMT tokens.
