The ALCEDO-Coin is one of the most important components in the entire ALCEDO project and is designed as an ERC-20 Ethereum-based token at the beginning of the ICO. Of course, ALCEDO-Coins can also be used as currency in addition to their use in the ALCEDO-Ecosystem. We will launch the ALCEDO-Coin in Q-4 2019. This token will be moved in the course of development to a separate blockchain, with the same number of coins and existing ALCE ERC20 tokens are exchanged at a rate of 1 : 1.  .ALCEDO-Reward System. 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Our customers can benefit from greatly reduced fees by using our ALCEDO-Ecosystem.To speed up the distribution and thus the circulation of ALCEDO-Coins, the use of our platform via ALCEDO- Coins is more favorable.

Every user who has 10 000 ALCE on the ALCEDO-Platform (web- or smart- phone-app) will not have to pay any transaction fees when using our services. However, depending on the Coin (except ALCEDO-Coin) a certain network fee remains, which we can not refund. This waiver applies to any service of ALCEDO (including all ALCEDO-ATMs).  .❈ ALCEDO-Wallet ❈.   000000000000000      The ALCEDO-Wallet drastically simplifies the handling of crypto currencies on the smartphone. Very simply, one can send and/or receive different coins. We offer at the start Bitcoin, Ethereum and the ALCEDO-Coin, but this assortment will be continually expanded.The Wallet is designed to work seamlessly with our crypto machines and the ALCEDO-Platform. For the exchange of Euro in crypto currency, the process is almost identical to getting coins at the machine, i.e. scanning the QR code and getting coins.
