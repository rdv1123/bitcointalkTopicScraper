So it should be an easy profit for you, just write a couple of posts, throw some ""memes"" and you good to go with your legendary badge (which could be bought aswell)  Or you're one of the guys who invested into MMM earlier in USA and didn't get out of there in time, kept playing, trying to make more & more, investing more & more and it ended up not nicely, because bitcoin price skyrocketed and MMM wasn't able to pay up promised 100%.    MMM and Mavro always gave people a chance to make money, some people got profit and got out, some people didn't lose anything, some people lost. That's how every business works, that's how life works. You should deal with it.  Matter of fact, you didn't do your research all too well. Because the last video from Mavrodi on his official/approved twitter was a month ago, where he spoke about recent political things in Russia. And you should know better.  Regarding why it was closed & relaunched: First and foremost, because the government didn't like that MMM was directly interfering with their political and economic views. Partners that were involved with MMM suddenly turned their backs on Sergei as soon as the government decided to take it down. And even through all of this Mavro did not close it for good, he offered to pay back 30% instead of the promised 100%. So you should take that into consideration.  Remember KIPI mydeposit? They just shut down everything without saying anything 0 refunds, 0 paybacks.  Mavrodi never hide his problems, and he actually told people about them, it's just people who didn't pull out earlier are angry at him, because those were all of their money and even tho he still payed out 30%.  I'm really sorry for you, but you have to learn from your experience no need to be all salty about it on every forum you go to and every thread about Mavro & MMM - that's unneeded bigotry.  People have to do their own research on projects they plan to invest into, they don't need your salty arse giving advices, cause you clearly can't manage your money, you only nice with the words.",True

A thread started by an account bought specifically for that purpose. Always a good sign..... #not really  And, in the ""whitepaper"" a picture of our old friend Sergey Panteleevich.  I see they've decided to use an old, old photo of the great Magic Money Man, from his younger revolutionary/anarcho capitalist/sociopath/socialist/Liberator and Saviour of the Oppressed incarnation.   (This collage is a recent one, referring to his old, worn out gifting scam called MMM, in its Nigerian iteration. Last time I bothered to look, it had been ""reset"" three times. ""Reset"" in this context means all money stolen, with a sort of promise that if you send some more, you might get some back. Happens to all MMM schemes. Involves huge losses for unsophisticated ""investors"" who have ""provided help"" out of a mixture of desperation and greed. A real Man of the People.)  Despite citing a Twitter account as ""proof"" that Mavrodi is behind this scheme, the truth is more like he is dead, stabbed with an ice pick (or was that some other Russian Hero of the People?). The last time I saw him ""live"", was a series of You Tube vids, mainly with his head circled by his arms, reassuring South African MMMers that ""all is well"". Very shortly after the videos stopped, so did the scheme. (See Nigeria for result.)    ""Mavros"" are nothing new by the way, MMM used them as back office tokens in order to destroy value at will.  And there's always this    Who else is part of this future of MLM, who is masterminding the Financial Future of the World?  Victor Geld....    ""Creator"", ""Ideologist"", ""Co-Founder"".......  or Alex, Estate Agent/Translator for hire?    and some ""Russian financial adviser"" called Stepan Demura. Whatever.  So, the future of currency is in the hands of these three illustrious gentlemen.   I see a few of the newbies (the few that aren't posting for rewards) are asking: what is this MLM which mavros will revolutionize?  MLM (Multi Level Marketing) is an American invention from the early 20th C. Because distances were so large and communications basic (no mobiles, no internet OMG) it was a way for a producer to expand its sales force and stockholders cheaply countrywide, with distributors recruited locally and rewards made on a pyramid basis. A hardworking ""downline"" was a valuable income for those near the top, and so it remains today. But time has caught up with MLM, it only exists legitimately now because of the huge inertia and legal and lobbying power of the big players like Amway, Avon, Tupperware etc. etc. and the desperation that drives most of their lower level participants to work for little reward. It's a shit, outmoded business model in the Age of Amazon, still here only because of corporate lobbying and the large rewards for the >1% at the top of the pyramid.  Like most systems with vested interest, MLM has mutated to survive and received some new energy in the context of recruiting victims for Ponzi Schemes. (Ponzi Schemes are simply fraudulent business models which only survive by using later ""investors"" funds to meet promised impossible returns on investment which have been made to early investors.) Tied to lucrative multi level recruitment schemes, they appear from nowhere, suck in investment and disappear. Organized Criminals or Freedom Fighters? Crypto is riddled with them (think mining, options trading etc.) also with noisy shills promoting them, excusing their lies with a ""personal responsibility"" mantra.  So which of the two types of MLM will make use of this 'mavro transparency' supposedly on offer here? Neither. Pseudo legitimate giants like Amway? No, if they wanted to they could easily employ their own blockchain, but they won't. In an industry which thrives on immense inequality of earnings and opportunity, the last thing they want is transparency. Ponzi schemes? Of course not. It would kill them.  Roadmap....  The first four stages successfully completed then. And what exactly has been achieved so far? You will see under Stage 2, 30% per month 'dividends' were paid. There was no economic activity creating wealth, just a Xerox machine (90's terminology). It was shut down, according to MMM orthodox propaganda, as a ""threat to the state"". In the 110 countries referred to in Stage 3, it was also shut down. So many states threatened......or just straight forward theft thru a simple Ponzi structure that devalued itself by design? Stage 10.... 2020, ""revolution in the worldwide economy"". I'm all for that, the sooner the better, but when Sergey says ""Financial Apocalypse is Inevitable"" (and has been saying for 25 years) he's referring to the personal financial apocalypse that comes from giving him money.  What has been will be.",True

Everybody knows that in 90s and 2011th turnover of MMM system exceeded several billion dollars. This time, the financial flow of the system will be implemented only in internal currency. The emission of the internal currency will be limited to 625 million tokens, and all of these tokens will be available at the ICO. Hard cap of ICO is only 100 000 EHT.  Nowadays it’s something about 110 million dollars. Have you alredy cathed up the essence of the all of it? If the emission of the tokens is limited and hard cup of the project is only 110 million dollars, then price of the token will rise up to 10 times! So x10 after ICO is minimum tokens rise up.",True

All of Mavrodi previous projects are famous for their huge volume of investments. The turnover of the system was over several billion dollars. Let us suppose, that the project of 2018 will have turnover at least 3 billion dollars. The financial flow of the project will be implemented in the tokens of the system, where the total amount of the tokens is 625 million.    Let’s make a calculation: The price of 1 MVR on the ICO is 0.0002 ETH (arround 24 cents for 1 MVR) Let’s imagine the turnover of the platform, that is backed by platform’s members, after ICO will be 3 billion dollars.    3 000 000 000$/625 000 000 tokens = 4.8 dollars per token. 4.8/0.24=20 - Twenty-fold increase!
