Our position is to talk openly about our problems and not to hide our heads in the sand. You need to know who and what is behind our project. Here are our mistakes. 1.   We did not attach any significance to the platform upon which the site was developed. As a result, the website simply failed the first stress-check. We were forced to postpone the start of the project and start developing the site upon a new platform. In addition to this, we changed our hosting. Now we are calm about the site and its functioning: a strong team took it in their hands, and it will solve all the issues arising online 24x7. 2.   We were so in a hurry to please you that we had hired a special bounty-manager without proper checking. This led to a decrease in reputation. Needless to say, this manager was fired. We are doing our best to restore the lost trust. At present, we are full of strength and determination to bring the EGH project to prosperity. All our investors of the first wave will be credited with additional double bonuses.",True

The project has already changed our own lives, but it still has to break the established paradigm that organic vegetables are too difficult, too expensive and unwanted. This is not true! We are ready to prove that greenhouses, designed with the latest engineering findings in mind, and using innovative materials, will allow growing natural vegetables and greens in the true natural soil. Agroinnovations from EGH are easy to scale and implement in any regions of Russia. You can easily become an active participant in this process, even if you do not understand anything in agriculture. Three years ago, when we were at the very start of our project, we had nothing but the desire to put on the table a bowl of fragrant and sweet tomatoes. We have learned from farmers of Russia, Holland and Singapore, we invited the best practitioners to our team, we developed technology and wrote a business plan, and now we take it all to the public.

According to J'son & Partners Consulting, the gross value of agricultural products per employee in our country in 2015 was $ 8,000, in Germany $ 24,000, in the US $ 195,000. The developed world enters the era of Agriculture 4.0. Harvest now depends not so much on the diligence of the farmer, but rather on the use of smart technologies: the Internet of things (today every 6th project in the IoT field is implemented in agriculture), analysis of large data, predictive analytics. Agro-market quickly merges with the IT industry which guarantees explosive growth in productivity at lower costs. This explains the high investment attractiveness of the industry. Seven years ago, venture investments in agro-startups did not exceed $ 400,000; in 2015 the market set a record - $ 4.6 billion. Annually 500 new projects emerge, and most start-ups ""grow"" in the fields of the USA, China, India, Canada, and Israel. Russia still has to strive hard to get to this top. Why? I completely agree with the answer given by J'son & Partners analysts: one of the reasons for Russia's technological backwardness is that cheap and low-quality food products prevail in the structure of consumption in our country. The authors of the study, referring to Rosstat and more respectable sources, say that consumption of meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables is lower than medical standards, and 2-3 times lower than in the US and Germany. A vicious circle: a farmer is barely making ends meet without having the resources to innovate while quality products are unavailable for a buyer. In a long chain of intermediaries, the price of the crop grows exponentially, but it does not yield much to those working the land directly: 90% of the sales from agricultural products remain in wholesale and retail trade, and with banks. Digitalization can change this. Reduce the supply chain and make all production and logistics processes as open as possible is the main task of our agricultural project, EcoGreenHouse (www.egh.io). The mechanism for this has already been thought up - blockchain. When buying our eco-tokens, you confirm membership in the EGH club and get the opportunity to purchase fresh vegetables grown by organic technology in living soil, at a cost of   25%, which is 5-10 times cheaper than in stores. #EcoGreenHouse, #egh, #ICO",True

Maybe you're not going to use GMO? If so you're simply supporting stereotypic views on Genetic Engineering aiming to earn money from the noneducated audience. 2) You're telling us, that your vegetables will be grown by artificial intelligence. It's called a-u-t-m-a-t-i-s-a-t-i-o-n and being implemented in each greenhouse on the Earth. 3) You want us to consider your product a premium segment. I got a question, who will buy them in Russia? As you know, it's financial crisis in here and most people not living but surviving. 4) Any scientific proof , that my life will last longer, if I eat so called ""organic food""?? Just trying to make sure you know, what you say on your website. 5)Btw. if you have really launched a successfull IPO, why are trying to launch ICO? Maybe because of the lack of legal control? You dont even use smart contract...so why the #$%@ you need blockchain? 6)Where is your WP?  I can ask a thousand more question, but I've already got you guys....SCAM.",True

Is it a stereotype or not? Of course, a stereotype, any common point of view is a stereotype. We will admit that the genetically modified plants have not passed the test of time. I personally know a dozen Ph.D. which are against GMO.  2   Automation is widely represented in greenhouses and this is wonderful. We are taking the next step - the machine will answer the question why the crop turned out this way and how to make it better.  3   The financial crisis is very loud words. According to the media, Russia lives in a crisis since 1985. Now only rich people can afford organic produce - it costs 5 times the same weight of vegetables grown in hydroponics. We are creating a club. Members of the club will be able to buy our vegetables at a cost plus 25%. For comparison, in a store, such products cost more than 5-10 times. We want our vegetables to be available to everyone.  4   Large agricultural producers put the number of produced products in the first place and apply different chemistry to achieve the result. If people were judged by their weight, the more, the better, then it is clear what they should eat. Any additives accumulate in the plant and eventually the person eats them. Why do you need chemistry? How will this chemistry behave in your body? For myself, I decided that vegetables without chemicals are my way.  5   The world is moving forward, and today there is an opportunity to attract crowdfunding. What would have happened to Facebook if the IPO had immediately passed? Yesterday, it was right way to attract venture capital, and today crowdfunding.",True
