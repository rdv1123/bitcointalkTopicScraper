Given the mechanism behind BlockFood's token sale, this amount can vary from: - The minimum total supply of BFT is: 14 285 710 BFT - The maximum total supply of BFT is: 925 714 280 BFT  The minimum amount we will distribute is: 714 280 BFT The maximum amount we will distribute is: 46 285 710 BFT  The total of BFT we are going to give to bounty hunters is distributed on 10 000 points. If you get 10 000 points, you get the whole pie. If you get 100 points, you get 1% of the amount of BFT we will distribute. The value of a point depends of the success of the project. The more the token sale is successful, the more BFT you will get.  Here is a recap of the value of a point depending on the final token sale result:  Token sale result (Eth) 1 000 5 000 10 000 15 000 25 000 40 000 54 000 Estimated BFT Supply 14 285 710 85 714 290 171 428 570 257 142 860 428 571 430 685 714 290 925 714 290 Distributed 714 290 4 285 710 8 571 430 12 857 140 21 428 570 34 285 710 46 285 710 1 points (BFT) 71 429 857 1 286 2 143 3 429 4 629 10 points 714 4 286 8 571 12 857 21 429 34 286 46 286 50 points 3 571 21 429 42 857 64 286 107 143 171 429 231 429 100 points 7 143 42 857 85 714 128 571 214 286 342 857 462 857  If the token sale is successful, participants will receive BFT with the following formula : Code: BOUNTY = (POINTS / TOTAL OF POINTS) * TOTAL_SUPPLY * 5%  Pre-sale campaigns  2000 points are dedicated to the pre-sale.
