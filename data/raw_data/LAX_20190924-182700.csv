Whitelist Bonus!,"   Are you sure its using X11 Algo? In whitepaper is stated Lyra2z as Algo.   Quote MINING LAPO, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both LAPO and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). Miners attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and when they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to the blockchain. If all the other people running the software agree that the problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and the miner is rewarded. LAPO is based on the Lyra2z mining algorithm, which encourages decentralisation by discouraging the use of ASIC hardware at the first stage of the project. This means that miners have good reasons to use affordable mining hardware that an average Hash rate to get good returns and that It can set up easily as well. We will launch the necessary tools for starting mining: • Gamers friendly: CPU /GPU both CUDA (Nvidia graphic cards) and OPENCL (AMD graphic cards) • Solo mining possibility • Mining through a pool Our long term goal is to be as more green as possible, for that reason we are already involved into the research of the next generation mining algorithm like Proof of Importance.",False
