Companies benefit greatly from these independent contractors, since it allows them to search for talent in all corners of the globe instead of being limited to their city. This is particularly true for companies searching for AI/IoT/blockchain developers, who can all do their jobs remotely. One of the biggest challenges facing companies when it comes to finding this valuable talent? The prevalence of fake profiles on social media channels and freelance platforms.  In order to cut out the aforementioned middleman, many companies will skip using recruiters and third-parties and search for developers on freelance platforms as well as social media channels like LinkedIn and Twitter. However, it’s only too easy to get scammed by someone who doesn’t have any true tech skills.  These candidates tout fake experience to match the needs of the company’s job listing or inquiry. They might also go as far as to use fake certificates in order to “back up” their skill set and put the company at ease.  The same goes for developers who are looking for valid AI/IoT/blockchain projects. With even more limited resources, it can be difficult to distinguish between a fake job listing and a legitimate opportunity. This can often lead them down a rabbit hole that results in no job, time lost, and potentially even stolen personal information. However, current technology has no solution for this issue, or sifting through the endless amount of fake profiles both for candidates and for companies.",True

If you have done your own research, you already know that ECTA is backed by Slovenian Government, and some parts of our of marketing and growth strategy is associated with them. We are working on whitepaper improvement, especially on token economics and ECTA Pay utility. All details will be disclosed soon, but I can reveal to you that we are planing to enable ECTA Pay transfer to fiat/tether and vice verse, also in plan is to integrate payment card for ECTA users.

Our protocol is geared by two token types:  ECTA PAY (fungible ERC20) and ECTA SKILLS (non-fungible, non-transferable ERC 721). On the basis of smart contract ECTA Pay tokens will enable seamless payment solution, contracting and protection between the developers on one side and client (company) on another side.  ECTA SKILLS non-fungible token’s purpose is holding a person’s (e.g. IT developer) accredited skill certificate/endorsement, which he/she will gain (mint) by successfully executing an agreed task, which is than approved by the contractor of the task. Each ECTA non-fungible token will hold the definition of a skill required by a successful task execution. One person can thus gain or mint multiple ECTA non-fungible tokens, with which he/she proves his competences. Since these ECTA non-fungible tokens are devoted to only a specific person, for his performed work, he/she should not and thus cannot transfer this earned token to any other person. This will be technically solved by not implementing the transfer function of the ERC721 standard and furthermore by storing the initial receiver’s information into the ECTA non-fungible token’s internal data (struct).  We are legally organized as a cooperative called ""Distributed Collective"" with an address in Slovenia.  ECTA is endorsed officially by the Ministry of Technology of Slovenia (letter) and we won the government tender of ""Solving the problems of precarious freelance workers in Slovenia"" whereby ECTA provides the solution locally prior to going global upon crowdsale. Moreover, our concept is endorsed by UN in New York as it addresses Sustainable Development Goals and helps in talent discovery and boosting of employability especially in low-middle income countries.",True

The concept, empowered by the proven AI tools, aims to solve the inefficiencies related to the time loss, verification of online profiles, talents discovery (especially in the low-middle income countries) and safe way to conduct business (payment solution with the power of smart contracts).  While working on ECTA platform, besides collecting their earnings in ECTA PAY tokens (ERC20) developers are having a unique possibility to earn (mine) ECTA SKILLS non-fungible/non-transferable tokens (ERC721) as a reward for every task completed -which serve as proof of their skills and boosting of reputation among others.  AI component of the platform helps companies worldwide to discover and employ these developers in a safe and productive way for both sides.  ECTA non-fungible token's purpose is holding a person's (e.g. IT developer) accredited skill certificate/endorsement, which he/she will gain (mint) by successfully executing an agreed task, which is than approved by the contractor of the task. Each ECTA non-fungible token will hold the definition of a skill required by a successful task execution. One person can thus gain or mint multiple ECTA non-fungible tokens, with which he/she proves his competences. Since these ECTA non-fungible tokens are devoted to only a specific person, for his performed work, he/she should not and thus cannot transfer this earned token to any other person. This will be technically solved by not implementing the transfer function of the ERC721 standard and furthermore by storing the initial receiver's information into the ECTA non-fungible token's internal data (struct).",True

Thanks to ECTA pay (fungible) tokens the unbanked developers worldwide won't struggle to collect their earnings for the services provided to individuals/companies. Also, when developers mine ECTA skills (non-fungible) tokens as the proof of services completed they will be more visible to other individuals/companies because their reputation will grow and they won't be suspicious to the future parties which want to hire them. So all process is open, intuitive, anti-fraudulent and rewarding. ECTA Team",True

ECTA AI engine detects and tracks individuals which demonstrated a certain achievements in terms of education, awards, initiatives, volunteering, cross-collaboration, publications, workshops, etc. (see our AI algorithm from www.eventregistry.org) Additionally, once the talent is discovered he will be notified and offered to increase his KYC what will enable him to collaborate with ECTA and become fully visible and ""employable"" to the parties in demand for him.

We will use components and know-how from the products already created by our team such as ARK, Edu-CTX, Eventregistry, etc. Thanks to blockchain we are able to integrate each component with another in synergy with AI tools and thus create an ecosystem of digital utilities which will serve to masses. We need ICO not just because of funds. Yes we need to pay the bills during the stages of development thats true but an ultimate goal of ICO is to distribute ECTA tokens to masses and by doing so to create sort of ""petrol stations"" where you can buy the ""fuel"" to benefit on using the ECTA platform no matter of you geographical presence, language and banking status. Inequalities will be reduced because everyone will have a chance to show his talent, provide services, create a value which will be recorded on the blockchain. Also, the platform will be multi-lingual.  ECTA Team ",True
