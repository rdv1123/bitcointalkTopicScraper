At this stage, most services are not yet ready for public use; 2️⃣ Beta - when the product acquires the outlines of a ready-made solution, but may contain errors and defects. At this stage, services can be accessed by focus groups for testing, or public functionality will be limited to the tested content; 3️⃣ Release version - the product is ready for release and operation. The product will be publicly available, but it is possible to correct errors found during its use.  At the moment, several teams are busy with the parallel development of the webmaster and advertiser interfaces, the tracking services, and the widgets for generating leads. Also, the development of the platform's smart contact and API for access to the blockchain network continues unabated.  ⚠️We are continuing to implement the advertiser’s personal account and in the near future, the team engaged in its development plans to start close integration of the advertiser and webmaster applications.⚠️  🔥All functionality development takes place in close interaction with each other stage as HOQU is developing not just a set of applications and components, but an integrated platform capable of fulfilling the most serious tasks facing all of the industry’s participants.🔥  In parallel with the development of applications and interfaces for webmasters and advertisers, our team of DevOps engineers is preparing an infrastructure base on the cloud structure of which all components of the platform will operate in the future. As a toolkit, we have chosen the Docker containerization and cluster building based on Kubernetes. Our engineers are sure that this system, which has proven itself as a reliable and a flexible solution, will serve as a good basis for the HOQU ecosystem.  🔅We hope that the updated roadmap will help our community and stakeholders better navigate the development stages of our platform and will prepare them for the important stages of its release.🔅  Stay tuned for more news and updates from HOQU as the project continues to develop.💪",False

This ensures transparency and honesty in relationships between advertisers, affiliates, and affiliate networks. 3)  On the HOQU platform, if an affiliate network acts against an affiliate’s interests, protection can be sought by filing a request to the appeal centers. 4)  In centralized affiliate networks, payments on traditional platforms and networks take between a few days to 2-3 months to process. HOQU smart contract payments take up to 10 minutes. 5)  Thanks to blockchain solutions, members of the HOQU platform are not connected to each other in this way and are not affected by hacking 6)  Functionality.

Please, very carefully read what I write! This concerns the developers of HOQU in the first place! In view of the introduction of KYC and the collection of personal data, a certain number of very serious questions appear to the organizers and developers of HOQU. The first thing you need to pay attention to is how the KYC form is organized. To fill in such forms, I should immediately see everything in the form included items, and not open in order only after the completion of the previous paragraph. The next question is about KYC demands. As I understand it, HOQU is registered in the UK, and in the UK there is no KYC legislation in relation to bounty hunters (only in relation to investors and only starting with a certain amount of investment). The argument ""we collect personal data just in case"" is not at all an argument from a legal position"". The next question: Who will have access to my personal data and personal information of the other participants in your campaign (personal data of bounty hunters and investors). On this account, there are already specific legal arguments.  Namely:  Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data Strasbourg, 28.I.1981  Article 8 – Additional safeguards for the data subject Any person shall be enabled: a) to establish the existence of an automated personal data file, its main purposes, as well as the identity and habitual residence or principal place of business of the controller of the file; b) to obtain at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense confirmation of whether personal data relating to him are stored in the automated data file as well as communication to him of such data in an intelligible form; c) to obtain, as the case may be, rectification or erasure of such data if these have been processed contrary to the provisions of domestic law giving effect to the basic principles set out in Articles 5 and 6 of this Convention; d) to have a remedy if a request for confirmation or, as the case may be, communication, rectification or erasure as referred to in paragraphs b and c of this article is not complied with.  Therefore, I ask the HOQU team to make a public and reasoned statement. I will not conduct any personal correspondence by e-mail. Please, show publicity and professionalism in this matter  To familiarize with the convention:  https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/108   List of States adopting the convention:  https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/108/declarations?p_auth=4NvQyP7U",False

On the HOQU platform, an advertiser can easily create affiliate offers, and the results of affiliate advertising campaigns will be stored in distributed registries (blockchain). Rewards will be paid through smart contracts that guarantee honesty and transparency of transactions. A smart anti-fraud system developed as part of the advertiser's decentralized application will not allow affiliates to engage in fraudulent activities, and independent, decentralized audit appeal centers will address any emerging, controversial issues. The HOQU platform will also be useful for existing affiliate networks. The SDK will enable one to integrate networks with the platform, thereby lowering the cost of paying affiliate fees. As well, it shall and add transparency to your network by enabling all affiliates registered within the platform to work with affiliate programs of the network.

The first WP page is written in terms that are incomprehensible to a person not engaged in advertising business. There is a dedicated editor in the team; the document is intended to send a message to an uninitiated audience, but nevertheless the market issues won’t be clear to an investor. 2.   Glossary of key terms appears right after the gist of the project. Why? To read it twice? 3.   The quotation: “The International Advertising Bureau identified the main problem for internet advertising and performance marketing as the establishing of common client action accounting mechanisms between advertisers (merchants) and affiliates” requires further specification (name of the Bureau) and references for the text of the paper/report/artcle/. 4.   Civic's identity verification – Why does a user need the application? 5.   Item 2.3 is not described at all.  Take it on trust? 6.   Item 2.6 – Affiliates will be obliged to return funds. How? 7.   There is a lack of real-life examples – How does the market work now and how will it work with HOQU. (the second part is partially described on page 16) 8.   Page 16 – “A flow of leads that are collected and processed by tracking services for a particular offer” – What are these tracking services, and who controls them? It is a guarantee of validity of the affiliates’ data, yet it’s not mentioned. The description is given only after 10 pages in technical part of the document. The issues of self-sufficiency and correct operation aren’t addressed. It questions integrity of the platform. 9.   Item 4.3 – “Data from the blockchain will be collected in real time, then processed and stored in a relational database” – Who owns this database? Are we back to centralization? 10.   Who makes a decision in the appeal centers? Is it under control of the platform? “The appeal centers have their own rating that is dependent on the adoption of equitable and prompt decisions on appeals arising” – What is that supposed to mean? What is this rating? Who decides whether it is a fair decision? 11.   The calculations inside the system are strange – “It is also possible to fix the cost of a lead to any fiat currency. In this case, the value of a lead will be calculated in HQX tokens at the internal exchange rate current at the moment the lead was created on the hoqu.com web service” – Exchange-rate volatility may cause profit or loss out of nothing. None of the system participants can predict it. 12.   Page 23 – Description of the connection to the API – So, if I don’t get an API-key, then I won’t be able to work with a customer? But what about openness? No one will give the keys to newcomers, thus an artificial barrier to entry is made. 13.   Page 24 – Anti-Fraud system - Where are these neural networks launched? What was used for machine learning? 14.   Page 25 – ""Each affiliate network can use different plugins for customization, and it is also possible to create custom plug-ins to be made available to affiliates"" - What is it? What for? 15.   Page 29 - The total of Hard cap at Pre-Sale and Hard cap at Main Sale does not equal to Total Hard Cap. 4952+97421!=104684 16.   Who needs tokens? A merchant buys them for fiat to pay for his task. A realizer gets them and converts back into fiat. What's the point of the tokens? Who will need them on the exchange? 17.   Predictions for the future growth of the platform are not well-reasoned. 18.   In the part about Project Economics, how the platform raises revenues is not mentioned. Previously in the text, a passing reference to 0.5% fee was made, but there is no information about it in the main section. 19.   Page 34 – ""Potential revenue from these directions for the HOQU platform is not taken into account in the financial model, but it will be present in the actual operation of the platform"" - How do leads from these channels get into tracking and system? 20.   Page 34 - HOQU team gets 30% of all tokens issued and an additional 10 % of 65% of all realized tokens? Why both? 21.   Page 34 – What is the difference between Global Expansion and Marketing? Why are these items divided? 22.   A chart on page 35 lacks sufficient substantiation; even an ""optimistic growth scenario"" in macro parameters (market share etc) is not described. 23.   Page 38 – Fiat deposit and withdrawal fees are not taken into account. In respect to big companies, there is an accounting issue – How do you balance the books? Target customer segment is big companies, and bookkeeping take precedence for them. 24.   Page 38 – “Easy start” – I’ve visited the current team project, upon which everything is being done - https://www.marketcall.ru/ - There is no hint of Easy start, FAQ at the beginning of the project occupy dozens of pages. 25.    Pictures are not translated to Russian. Comments below are given partially. 26.   According to the roadmap, NOTHING is ready thus far.   A brief summary: •   The project is described poorly – it is unclear to an investor who is not engaged in advertising; there is no mention of the project’s revenue source in the part about Project Economics. •   Decentralization is very much an open question – particularly with regard to the relational database, tracking and appeals. •   Key details of the project i.e. anti-fraud and lead tracker are not described in implementation plan. •   There are no prerequisites for the rise in the value of tokens in the project. It doesn't really make any sense for platform members to keep tokens in the wallet. •   To date, the team doesn’t have any element completed.",False

Hope you are happy with the answers:      4. Civic’s identification will be implemented if they release the functionality that they promise to give to the users. We have tried to work with Civic and their real solution is different from their white paper’s product, which looks like a scam. Currently we plan to do KYC by our own.    6.   Item 2.6 – Affiliates will be obliged to return funds. How?  6. For this specific purpose we have implemented allowance method with HQX smart-contract which will deduct tokens from accounts of merchants and affiliates.  Merchants can demand to allocate a proportion of payed out tokens as  a deposit for affiliates with 0 reputation. This means that a webmaster does not receive an amount of token reward for his job until he earns a higher reputation level so you can say that this amount is always «on hold» until certain critters are met by a webmaster, which guarantees money back in case of disputes.    8.   Page 16 – “A flow of leads that are collected and processed by tracking services for a particular offer” – What are these tracking services, and who controls them? It is a guarantee of validity of the affiliates’ data, yet it’s not mentioned. The description is given only after 10 pages in technical part of the document. The issues of self-sufficiency and correct operation aren’t addressed. It questions integrity of the platform.  8. Tracking services are the service which track leads. For instance, if you want to track calls - we have an Asterisk server. During first stages of platform development HOQU will offer tracking service and as platform develops we assume community of merchants and web-masterss will be using other tracking providers. Another instance: an affiliate networks wants to organise leads auction. They create separate tracking service which receives leads and sorts them between auction participants. This feature of registering independent tracking services is possible only if following criterias are met: - There is a processed deposit which will guarantee tracking service work - Founders are voting «for» this tracking service registration - Community members with high reputation may also vote for or against this tracking service registration This list is not finished and full methodology is to be developed further and will be available to everyone.    9.   Item 4.3 – “Data from the blockchain will be collected in real time, then processed and stored in a relational database” – Who owns this database? Are we back to centralization?  9. We will create blockchain explorer on HOQU.com basis with open API. No centralisation is included we just make things easier. If a user wants to create an aggregator he has no need to download and install the blockchain node and read all the info from it. 3rd party programs will also read all the info from explorer and not from blockchain because it is not always appropriate to allow to do this: sometimes we read from the blockchain for a fraction of a second and sometimes more than 60 seconds.     10.   Who makes a decision in the appeal centers? Is it under control of the platform? “The appeal centers have their own rating that is dependent on the adoption of equitable and prompt decisions on appeals arising” – What is that supposed to mean? What is this rating? Who decides whether it is a fair decision?  10. Appeal centers, similar to  tracking services development will be implemented by hoqu.com for the early stages of platform running. Later on there will be a possibility to register independent appeal centers. Lets say that you are an affiliate network and you can create your own appeal center. Other community members and enthusiasts may create independent centers and take a fee for disputes settlement.   11.   The calculations inside the system are strange – “It is also possible to fix the cost of a lead to any fiat currency. In this case, the value of a lead will be calculated in HQX tokens at the internal exchange rate current at the moment the lead was created on the hoqu.com web service” – Exchange-rate volatility may cause profit or loss out of nothing. None of the system participants can predict it.  11. Volatility - is a headache of all the crypto projects. There are a lot of ways how to decrease or eliminate it. The example of connection payout rate to a fiat currency is just one of them. Each participant places his own offer parameters and others decide to work or not on these terms. In other words to take the risks or not. There is a room for intermediaries who will take volatility and FX risks and provide services for platform participants in fait currencies.    12.   Page 23 – Description of the connection to the API – So, if I don’t get an API-key, then I won’t be able to work with a customer? But what about openness? No one will give the keys to newcomers, thus an artificial barrier to entry is made.  12. That is correct. Many affiliate networks do not take in just anyone. There may be restrictions and minimum experience and reputation demand to qualify to enter a particular affiliate network. Others network may create a separate offer for a particular partner. But we imagine most of the affiliate networks to be open.   13.   Page 24 – Anti-Fraud system - Where are these neural networks launched? What was used for machine learning?  13. Neural networks are learning from customers’ characteristics. Input parameters:  time spent on web-site, activity (number of actions per time), pages jumps, clicks, mouse movements and scroll buttons hits, browser info and etc. To make neural network lear we outsource this feature from a partner so they serve the traffic.  Concerning calls - we provide all the info for a neural network by ourselves. We analyse more than 20 characteristics such as call length, time of the day, region code, telephony service provider and etc. Currently we have around 342 thousand calls for studies.   14.   Page 25 – ""Each affiliate network can use different plugins for customization, and it is also possible to create custom plug-ins to be made available to affiliates"" - What is it? What for?  14. Currently we integrate MarketCall affiliate network into HOQU. Plugins: personal manager panel, on-line chat, affiliate network’s news and ticket systems.   19.   Page 34 – ""Potential revenue from these directions for the HOQU platform is not taken into account in the financial model, but it will be present in the actual operation of the platform"" - How do leads from these channels get into tracking and system?  19. For each source a partner uses separately rented telephone number of an affiliate network. This allows to track phone calls from any source including radio, printed sources, outdoor and etc. This model is already implemented and successfully working in the MarketCall company.   26.   According to the roadmap, NOTHING is ready thus far.  26. We already have almost finished smart contract prototype on a blockchain and MVP, here is the screenshot   The video with the MVP is going to be presented on Monday, 27 of November. For institutional investors we are planning to do a live demonstration face-to-face..   A brief summary: •   The project is described poorly – it is unclear to an investor who is not engaged in advertising; there is no mention of the project’s revenue source in the part about Project Economics. •   Decentralization is very much an open question – particularly with regard to the relational database, tracking and appeals. •   Key details of the project i.e. anti-fraud and lead tracker are not described in implementation plan. •   There are no prerequisites for the rise in the value of tokens in the project. It doesn't really make any sense for platform members to keep tokens in the wallet. •   To date, the team doesn’t have any element completed.   I want to note about your «summary»: •   white paper is not a technical paper •   Our product is really complex to be understood using only technical terms •   While writing the white paper a lot of material has been cut by our advisors not to clog it and make easier to read and understand. Otherwise the volume would be enormous. •   There are a lot of preconditions for token price increase. It is a matter of a few week and we Will announce the agreements with partners who are doing marketing by pay per ICO model  From complited features we can name •   Smart contract prototype •   Web-application of a web-master •   Web-application of a merchant   P.S. All technical questions May be asked directly to @eclmadfly by telegram chat. P.S.S. Respect us and yourself, do not ask the same questions in multiple threads and Telegram chat if you are so savvy in this area.",False

Smart contract closes a transaction once it sees a trigger factor on the blockchain. Let’s take an example. A developer and an affiliate enter into contract that obliges the affiliate to drive traffic to the website to encourage apartment sales. As soon as blockchain provides information that the apartment has been sold, smart contract makes a payout (% of transaction value) to the affiliate.  So all the participants have clear understanding what is going to happen ensuring trust between the parties.

Affiliate network includes 4 types of participants: Merchant, Affiliate Network that deals with data flow and payouts, Affiliate, and Customer.   Merchant uses the affiliate network to add offers. Offers specify a certain type of data (lead) Merchant is willing to pay for (lead cost). Affiliate launches and maintains their own marketing network that may include websites, call centers, outdoor advertising, and other methods to acquire customers. By using marketing schemes, Affiliate obtains a piece of customer data (lead) that fits the offer and adds it to the affiliate network. Affiliate can do that directly or by using a tracker service that creates a lead in the required format and adds it to the affiliate network. For the most part, the lead is sent to Merchant, while meta-information with lead, offer and affiliate data is added to the affiliate network. If the lead is encrypted, Merchant only receives it upon approval by the network. If Merchant approves the lead (or doesn’t decline it within a certain timeout), the lead cost is charged from the Merchant’s account. After the network charges a commission, Affiliate receives the remaining amount (price). If Merchant declines the lead, it is sent back to Affiliate. Affiliate can sell the lead to any interested party or put it up for auction.  Using the core concept of an affiliate network, HOQU aims to enhance transparency and integrity of transactions between its participants through applying Blockchain technology for core logic and payments. Plus, HOQU creates opportunities not only for merchants and affiliates, but also affiliate networks. An affiliate network can add its available offers to HOQU to manage leads with more transparency. HOQU affiliates will be able to see offers added by the affiliate network and engage with them immediately. Let’s take a look at the core smart contract functionalities available to all participants.  All payments are made in HOQU tokens (HQX). By requesting buyToken method, any participant can buy HQX with a certain amount of ETH. Total amount of HQX credited to the participant’s account is determined by the rate To join as Affiliate, you just need to have an Ethereum address to request smart contract methods and receive payouts in HQX. Affiliate can either work directly via platform, or use tracker services. Affiliate networks can also join as HOQU Affiliate to act as a broker for its affiliates. To join as Merchant, you need to request allowance method and set a budget. By doing so, you give HOQU smart contract a permission to write off the cost of the lead from your account if you decide to buy it. Unless such a permission is given, the account owner is the only one who can manage HQX tokens. Affiliate networks can also join as HOQU Merchant to act as a broker for their merchants. To join as Affiliate Network, you need to add network information to HoQu platform by requesting addNetwork method. You need to submit the network identifier (to link together all offers within the network), network name, and url with network information. To add an offer, Merchant needs to request addOffer method and provide the offer identifier; affiliate network identifier (if the offer added is a part of affiliate network); offer name; and url with offer information. Affiliates (or affiliate networks) must refer to the information under this url to create offers in the required format and send them to merchant by using the method convenient to the merchant. For most offers, HoQu will provide special tracker services to collect, create, and deliver leads on a certain offer and add offer metadata to the platform. To add a lead to the system, Affiliate needs to request addLead method and submit the lead identifier; offer identifier; url address with the lead (if Affiliate delivers the lead to Merchant by themselves, URL field remains empty); password to get access to lead data; and lead metadata in the form of a string. Metadata format is determined by Merchant and may contain any information Merchant may need to approve the lead. Once the lead is added, the owner of the respective offer will receive an event. After checking lead metadata, the owner of the offer can approve the lead by requesting approveLead method and giving the lead identifier. If the owner of the offer fails to decline the lead within a set timeout, smart contract requests approveLead automatically and performs the following actions:  - lead cost in HQX is charged from the address of the winning offer owner  - lead cost in HQX (minus 0.5% commission) is credited to the address of the lead owner   - offer owner is provided with a password to access the lead data. If, after checking lead metadata, the offer owner refuses to approve it, they need to request declineLead method and submit the lead identifier. The lead status will be updated, and the lead owner will receive a decline event. If the lead was added by a tracker service, Affiliate will get access to the lead data to dispose of the lead as they deem appropriate.  We understand that using Ethereum wallets and requesting smart contract methods require certain technical skills and resources from system participants. To HOQU participants who don’t want to create their technical solutions by using our SDK, we’re offering an easy to use web app (desktop and mobile version). Its server side implements the logic described above and requests smart contracts by using service API. All transactions will be conducted through blockchain (but through our API), allowing to maintain transparency and decentralization. Participants will simply need to register a HOQU account, make a deposit in any suitable currency, and start using the system.  All smart contract methods are provided for information only. The final implementation will surely be different from the logic described above and may be distributed between several contracts. Examples of the above-mentioned contracts, HQX token contract, and ICO contracts are available on GitHub",False

What is Hoqu  HOQU — is a decentralized affiliate platform that brings together performance marketing model and blockchain technology. The goal is to create a decentralized eco-system to launch blockchain-based CPA services, from affiliate programs to affiliate networks and related products. By bringing together merchants, networks and affiliates, HOQU can drastically reduce costs of all market players and set new transparency and performance standards.  Market overview  In 2010-2016, the global market of online advertising was growing by 15-22% a year. According to Statista, Magna and eMarketer, the market will account for over $227 bln in 2017 and over $335 bln by 2020. During the next 5 years, the global share of online advertising is expected to grow from 36% to 50%. Affiliate marketing is currently a major online advertising model, both in terms of market share and growth. Affiliate marketing focuses on actual measurable result and provides payouts for target actions only. Although highly promising for all players, the market is facing tough challenges that undermine its growth:  ● Existing market tools fail to solve the problem of cheating by merchants and affiliate networks and affiliate fraud (fraudulent calls, leads, etc.). ● There are thousands of affiliate networks with their own affiliate bases. Integrating with them takes a lot of time, though. Becoming a part of one of such networks requires lengthy integration ● Today, merchants have to pay ridiculously high transactions costs and broker fees. For example, affiliates and merchants are charged 3-5% of advertising budget by payment systems, 15-25% by PA and CPA networks, and 5-15% by advertising platforms and services ● To make payouts to affiliates, centralized affiliate networks need from several days to 2-3 months.  HOQU advantages  HOQU can solve burning market problems  Drastic cost reduction at all stages. HOQU’s own cryptocurrency will allow to reduce transaction costs and fees charged by financial institutions and payment services. On HOQU, merchants can launch their own affiliate programs and work directly with affiliates, cutting advertising costs by 44% Unlike centralized tracking platforms, we have no fixed monthly payments for using our decentralized platform. Blockchain solutions will allow to reduce user data storage costs. With user data stored on external platforms, HOQU will be able to set lower fees for affiliates and merchants. Merchants will only pay 0.5% of transaction value. Plus, HOQU modules operate independently. If one module fails or is hacked, other modules will continue to operate properly. This ensures high level of security for all platform participants. Reduced affiliate payout times. Smart contract automatically checks whether a lead qualifies for a payout, making immediate payouts to affiliates possible. Anti-fraud protection.HOQU uses Civic blockchain platform for user identification. Civic solves the problem of remote identification and integrates with other blockchain solutions. Smart contracts, reputation monitoring system and CPA model leave no space for fraud. Smart contracts ensure transparent and integral deals between merchants, affiliates, and affiliate networks. No need to create your own software solutions. HOQU is a brand new tracker platform that enables users to launch their own affiliate programs and CPA networks absolutely for free. No need to integrate with hundreds of affiliate networks. HOQU is a fully decentralized platform, meaning that a merchant simply needs to install an app to get access to all CPA networks and affiliates within HOQU platform. Future of marketing. An increasing number of industries are switching to blockchain technology. Using HOQU to attract clients into those industries is an ideal example of performance marketing. For example, HOQU will be a great place for merchants searching for investors to launch an Token Sale run. With HOQU, companies will be able to acquire thousands of investors in a fast and easy way. Merchant companies will have every cent of their money spent wisely, with costs ranging from 1% to 4%  To affiliate networks, we can offer affordable, technologically superior infrastructure. HOQU will be the only platform where affiliate networks will be using blockchain and smart contracts.  Benefits for buyers Costs down by 44% of advertising budget Blockchain solutions leave almost no space for fraud No need to integrate with multiple CPA networks to ensure full outreach Merchant can work with any affiliates registered with any services within HOQU platform All data are available in one personal account, regardless of the number of networks  Benefits for affiliates & CPA-networks For Affiliates Open merchant base Fair and transparent smart contract transactions CPS (Cost-per-Sale) model available Fast payouts  For CPA Networks Easy access, given free use and a vast pool of merchants and affiliates Fair reputation ranking Fair competition     Bounty Campaign   Bounty amount:17 777 760 HQx (1 HQX = 0.0002 ETH) Bounty allocation: 39% (6 933 326 HQx) Signature & Avatar Campaign 26% (4 622 218 HQx) Content creation 20% (3 555 552 HQx) Social media, incl.: Twitter Facebook Medium Telegram YouTube Reddit Instagram WeChat 15% (2 666 664 HQx) Translation and moderation    White Paper  https://www.hoqu.io/hoqu-whitepaper-en.pdf Our presentation  Join us                                   Who we are HOQU team have an extensive experience in various business projects, e-commerce, digital economics, online advertising, affiliate marketing, and payment systems.
