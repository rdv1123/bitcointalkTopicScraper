Hard cap 40000 ETH seems very very high considering that it's just an app on ethereum blockchain with lots of competition(on blockchain and outside this space). Also you can't say ""RENC is car sharing service platform and blockchain."" because it's not true, your are building an app on top of ethereum blockchain and it can't be blockchain itself. Correct if I'm wrong",False
