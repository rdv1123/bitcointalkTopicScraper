Unfortunately, it seems that the CEO did an exit scam. Apparently, he used somebody else's identity. A thread about this can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5147318.0  His actions cast a poor light on me and the rest of the contributors because he added us to the team section on the website. Now that I think of it, maybe that is why the CEO pressured the contributors to get their name and face on the website - he needed scapegoats.  However, me and the rest of the contributors got paid by tokens that never got listed on an exchange so we did not make any money out of this. All the work we put into this project was for nothing, so we are victims as well. The only difference is that we did not put money into this like causual investors, but endless hours of work. I was managing their Telegram with more than 90k members which was not an easy task.   After I couldn't reach Demetrius (CEO) anymore, I contacted the COO Eric Van Loon through Facebook in March this year. Unfortunately, he has never replied to me of what is going on. He also did an interview with a YouTuber which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTetuEiiSns  Judging by his LinkedIn, he owns a taxi advertising company. Hard to tell if he was also part of the scam. Let's wait and see what he has to say before you jump to any conclusions. I recently contacted him again and await an answer. Maybe he can shed some light on this. It is very unfortunate because the idea of Tachain was actually very innovative.   Kind regards Marcus",False

Lyft/Uber basically own the self-employed driver service market, there are hundreds of established ad companies that turn over billions, there are hundreds of blockchain based ad networks that probably advertise in taxis/public transport already and cover lots of other different areas (mobile apps, social media, etc.), and there are thousands of cryptocurrencies that could be used as incentives.  I get that all of Tachain's ideas and features will come together as one and it could be an amazing ecosystem if it is adopted by enough users to be a profitable business, but they need to persuade people to move away from companies that already dominate the industries they want to enter, so they can grow their own user base. They need to stand out, they need to secure big partnerships, all of this costs a lot of money.

It provides comprehensive ad targeting system for advertisers while maintaining full security and effectiveness of a full scale transportation app. With our functionalities in play, we are in a position to steer toward our mission of providing a valid and secure blockchain based service full of fun and joy to our users.  Our three main features are:  Technologies have advanced further: in both the transport and advertising industries the substantial technological jumps that have been made over the years are evident; however, there is no synergy among them. Innovating the travel service and advertising industries: combining our elements with the latest technologies, our platform substantially widens the opportunities for advertisers and Tachain application users. Our platforms: the Tachain ecosystem is made up of a number of components working together with Transportal, advertising platform AdNet and token market TMARQ.      _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Tachain Ecosystem _______________________________________________________________________________ ________   Tachain AdNet  Tachain is planning to create AdNet so that application users would be able to watch advertisements while driving in a taxi, public or any other transport and earn TCHN tokens for this. Advertisers will need TCHN tokens in order to get access to the platform and run their ads. Advertisers will pay app users TCHN tokens for watching targeted ads.  We are creating the platform for advertisers and advertising agencies. Every element of the platform will get benefits based on market conditions of supply and demand.  Users of Tachain application - taxi or public transport passengers - will also get benefits. AdNet is revolutionary platform, which will allow passengers to watch advertisements, participate in branding marketing events, lotteries, games right during their ride and earn TCHN tokens for doing that.  AdNet will become an effective marketing tool and will be used by big companies, as well as by small and medium-sized enterprises interested in promotion of their product, service, or their brand in general. Advertisers will be able to buy advertising slots via convenient and flexible interface of personal cabinet on Tachain web-page. It will be possible to create advertising campaigns using own marketing materials, as well as preparing them in our creative constructor. When creating a campaign, an advertiser will have an opportunity to deeply customize targeting settings based on geographical, physical and behavioural patterns of targeted audience and chosen type of advertising platform. AdNet will allow advertisers to operate with any budgets starting from small testing budgets up until complete yearly contracts, etc. Advertising prices will be determined by the market, based on real supply and demand in particular advertising platforms of targeting.    Rewards on our advertising platforms will be paid out in TCHN tokens based on CPM/CPI, CPC, CPL and CPS models. The amount will be dependant on market conditions and real demand for advertising. Exchange of TCHN tokens will be available for all the users of Tachain ecosystem on our own TMARQ or on external exchanges.   Tahain TMARQ  Tachain will create token market TMARQ for TCHN tokens. There is number of players in Tachain ecosystem:  Passengers (mobile application users); Drivers; Taxi companies; Advertisers; Tachain itself.  In order to give the players opportunity to easily turnover TCHN tokens between them, TMARQ will be created that will allow using mobile application to buy/sell tokens in a matter of seconds, as there will always be substantial demand for TCHN tokens by advertisers. Together with the growth of Tachain transportation provider network, AdNet is going to grow substantially and it will provide long-term growth in TCHN token value.   Tachain Transportal  At the moment Tachain application is a taxi booking app for the consumer and companies. It is a full service taxi booking application for the taxi branch. We organize the backend, trainings, customer service, marketing, screens in the taxis and updates in the application. The only thing that the taxi operator needs to do is to deliver a clean and convenient car with a friendly driver.  The application will have smart rating system for taxi drivers and users. All the rating information and statistics will be stored in blockchain and will be available to everybody using the network.  In 2018 we will introduce Tachain to the market in the Philippines and from October 2018 we will start with 3000 taxis in the city of Manila.  The first version of Tachain application has already been developed and soon will be available in AppStore and GooglePlay.  Further the application will grow into Transportal through which users will be able to plan all their activities related to logistics. In general, application will become the one solution for time management and logistics planning.    _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  TCHN Utility Token _______________________________________________________________________________ ________   Our ecosystem is tokenized in order to empower users to use it more often, as well as attract companies to advertise their products and services on our platform.  Transportation providers and users earn TCHN tokens for traveling. Advertisers will need TCHN tokens in order to access advertising platform and penetrate users with targeted ads. Users can use TCHN tokens in order to pay for rides, as well as can sell them on TMARQ marketplace or on external exchanges. Users additionally earn tokens for watching targeted ads. Transportation providers can sell tokens at TMARQ marketplace and external exchanges.
