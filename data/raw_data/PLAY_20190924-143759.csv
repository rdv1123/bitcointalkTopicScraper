And the ecosystem will grant Content Providers access to new ways of content distribution and chance to reach a new audience. The LetItPlay ecosystem will connect not only Content Providers and general Consumers, but also Service Providers i.e., those who put in their effort to produce audio content, including voiceover artists, audio recording studios, translators, editors, and so on.  Also, we have PlayPower. PlayPower in LetItPlay is similar to SteemPower in the Steem blockchain. PlayPower is also a stake (Stake in blockchain with Delegated Proof of Stake consensus algorithm). But application logic associated with PlayPower differs from SteemPower. PlayPower is used to determine influence of ecosystem participants. Each user category of the LetItPlay ecosystem may use PlayPower for different purposes.  The amount of PlayPower determines the size of a reward issued by the blockchain for user attention. PlayPower can also influence the likelihood of content inclusion into content recommended to the user, if content is tied to a certain territory. For example, a regional news portal may set a news coverage area within a single region or city in which the news is relevant. The likelihood that such content is recommended in each point of the region will depend on the degree of influence in specific geographic position. The degree of influence of the news for the selected region will be calculated using formula PlayPower/Region Area. By setting a small news coverage area a Content Provider having smaller amount of PlayPower can compete in recommendations on the same footing as larger Content Providers.",False

For convenience of all ecosystem participants, there will be an internal exchange within the LetItPlay ecosystem. The internal exchange will allow participants to exchange Play tokens to other cryptoassets and convert them to fiat currencies.  - The internal exchange will solve the following tasks: Provide ease of entry of new participants into the ecosystem so that they could easily buy Play tokens for later use within the ecosystem.  - Smooth out volatility of cryptocurrencies for companies operating in the real sector of economy. For example, Service Providers and Content Providers pay mainly in conventional fiat currencies. So, volatile fluctuations that are typical for the cryptocurrency market are not desirable for them. To mitigate volatility risks, they need to hold a part of their revenues in assets pegged to fiat currency system to make sure that they can cover their current expenses. To this end, they will have a chance to exchange Play tokens to other tokens, national cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies on the internal exchange.  - Business gateway. For businesses that keep rigorous records, we will create national gateways for deposits and withdrawals of fiat currencies with proper workflow and in observance of local laws. This is a prerequisite for entry of large advertisers, news agencies, and service providers into the ecosystem.",False

Many of them operate in real sectors of the economy and pay in conventional currencies. For the purpose of ensuring initial stability of the Play token rate, we have allocated a budget to be spent on support of Service Providers who provide services at a fixed rate. By pegging the rate of a Play token to the cost of real economy services we will protect it against any slumps.  Stable growth of the Play token rate will be driven by two factors:  - Demand for Play tokens for conversion to PlayPower in order to enhance own influence and competitive capacity in the ecosystem. - External demand for tokens from Advertisers who otherwise are unable to pay Consumers for ads.  PlayPower in LetItPlay is similar to SteemPower in the Steem blockchain. PlayPower is also a stake (Stake in blockchain with Delegated Proof of Stake consensus algorithm). But application logic associated with PlayPower differs from SteemPower. PlayPower is used to determine influence of ecosystem participants. Each user category of the LetItPlay ecosystem may use PlayPower for different purposes.",False
