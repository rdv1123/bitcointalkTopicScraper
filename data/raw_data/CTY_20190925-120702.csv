First of all, Connecty was born in the scientific community, with people who really are scientifics. This is not yet another project launched by a marketing team that decided to do an ICO to make money. The people behind this project are scientists recognized in their fields.  Secondly, the team around connecty (about 60 people) is essentially composed of volunteers who really believe in the project, and are not there for profit.  Thirdly, the soft cap is realistic (1 million euros) we are far from the ICOS with fanciful thresholds and which will never see the light of day.  Fourthly, from the beginning Connecty's team decided to do this under French and therefore European rules, which makes it more complex, but also shows the long-term vision of the project, with the idea of being serious and sustainable over time.  fifthly, Connecty has announced serious partnerships, in particular with the French public investment bank and other partners from the research world, which can only be a guarantee of seriousness.  Finally, Connecty was born from the idea of really responding to a need of scientists. To fill a gap in their daily functioning.  It is for all these reasons that I think Connecty is a good ICO and that it can be interesting to explore the subject further and why not invest a little bit in it.",False

The goal of Connecty.io is to connect the world of knowledge (scientists, experts, etc) with the innovative world (start-up, small or big companies). The challenge is to promote, simplify and make faster trades between those two worlds to revitalise the knowledge economy, dramatically increasing its efficiency and performance.   Connecty.io desires to become one of the largest exchange places, a sort of a B2B Quora, where people looking for answers can find and trade information with those owning skills and knowledge.  The three main features are: An ambitious A.I engine that will be able to automatically translate any request from common language with simple words to a complex and technical one. This means that the system will be able to simplify any scientific jargon into an easily readable and manageable language. We have as advisor one of the best experts in the field with Olivier Nerot A list of experts and scientists gathering knowledge owners from every field: physical sciences, mathematics, biology, economic sciences, psychology A system that connects and secures transactions and allows the creation of a trustful environment between different people. This system will be based on blockchain technology, using smart contracts to manage missions and a reputation rate system.     _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Who are Connecty addressing? _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  CONNECTY is a platform for linking, dating and matching between two distinct populations : The knowledge creator creators (researchers, laboratories, universities), and the innovators (entrepreneurs, SMEs, large groups). Our platform is a synthesis of three major features:    The first and main target is the world of research and development (R&D). In 2015, this market was estimated to be worth 1.9 trillion US$ worldwide. In extension, the portion of this market that represented research coming out of labs and used for corporate purposes was only of 7%, corresponding to 135 billions US$. The percentage is low because in the current system, trades are limited by administrative difficulties that remain a hurdle for small trades (small trades that often consist of a few phone calls and a one-day mission).   _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Why a dedicated token and the use of the blockchain ? _______________________________________________________________________________ ________   The creation of this new currency is necessary for three main reasons:  Rating knowledge trades with currency. the world of science hates money. Most scientists and other kinds of knowledge owners aren?t motivated by money. Their objective is to create knowledge and in general, they are fundamentally opposed to the financial model. Using a token allows us to overcome this hurdle. It will also have multiple use cases on our platform (purchase books, reviews, subscriptions to scientific and tech magazines, tickets for conferences and salons?). The knowledge owner will, in the end, never have to use FIAT currencies if they so desire. They can sell knowledge for CTY, purchase other knowledge for CTY, creating new knowledge in the process.  Setting up a circular knowledge economy. The challenge is to allow the free and unlimited trade of knowledge between people, without restrictions. But trades still have to be measured and quantified to be fair to those who share knowledge. Those sharing the most will be able to use their earned tokens and spend them through our knowledge store or convert them into the currency of their choice.  A reliable and secure trade option for this global scale project. Stellar tokens bring all the positive features of the blockchain: Security, decentralization, confidentiality, very low operating cost. But it also brings aspects of the Smart Contracts technology (automatisation of processes, flexibility, trust and reliable environment...).   The CTY token is a utility type token, namely intended to be used as knowledge currency on the Connecty.io platform, to take advantage of all the services offered on it.  The currency of Knowledge, CTY, will have different roles: To purchase knowledge on the platform from those selling it (certified experts, reliable professionals, scientists, technicians, specialists). To purchase goods & services in our knowledge store, sponsored by professional companies of different kinds (editors, magazines, newspapers, event managers). To allow the easy conversion into FIAT currencies to spend as you wish. Or perhaps, to finance research or business related projects.  _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  How Connecty.io can be used ? _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Innovative entrepreneur specialized in high precision mechanical (www.expertisevision.fr) :   He develops a brand new machine to inspect mechanical pieces for the watch industry. He need for high precision, high performance and  high quality. He needs to enhance the algorithm that analyses images in order to gain accuracy and efficiency, and detect more complex shapes. He wrote his request on Connecty.io and he now gets in touch with an NASA researcher. He shows his last revolutionizing algorithm he published to our engineer. All he has to do now is to implement it in his new machine, making it the most competitive one on the market.  Investment: two days spent with a researcher and one month of development on his own. Results: a leading market position   Contracts are automated with smart-contracts.Payments are made with CTY (connecty). An additional system allows anyone to purchase directly CTY tokens at market price on our website. CTYs earned by someone for his/her services can be reused on Connecty.io or converted into FIAT currency.   _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Leading team and advisors : _______________________________________________________________________________ ________   Olivier Alirol - Julien Brodier - Philippe Chometton - Delphine Colombet - Coryne Nicq - Florence Perrier - Samuel Troncon    Idriss aberkane - François de Chezelles - Sébastien Deschaux - Rith Ho Jérôme Jubelin - François Xavier Marquis - Olivier Nerot - Alissa Pelatan Thibault Verbiestn - Franck Zal - Pierre Cappelli - Ali YAzbek  _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Connecty trailer and videos : _______________________________________________________________________________ ________   Enable english subtitles in youtube settings           _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Road map : _______________________________________________________________________________ ________     Come and test our Alpha version to be put in touch with the right company among the 30k available in our network. https://app.connecty.io/    _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Informations ICO : _______________________________________________________________________________ ________      Connecty token symbol : CTY Total supply : 2 500 000 000 Starting value CTY : 1 CTY = 0,01€    Participate in the Connecty ICO  _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Social media : _______________________________________________________________________________ ________                         _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Bitcointalk link : _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  [ANN][PRESALE] French thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Spanish thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Portugese thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Dutch thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Russian thread  [ANN][PRESALE] German thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Italian thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Croatian thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Romanian thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Turkish thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Ukrainian thread  [ANN][PRESALE] Filipino thread  _______________________________________________________________________________ ________  Connecty Bounty Campaign _______________________________________________________________________________ ________   [BOUNTY THREAD] CONNECTY",False

We had in the fisrt hint the x-rays that revolutionized the medical field discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen. The hexadecimal points to this link bit.ly/eFf3c. Link that shows us, the Doppler effect in practice. Discovered by Christian Doppler. Third hint was a password locked archive hidden on our website. The password was as follows: RontgenDoppler Once this archive opened it let appear an image of the constelation of the Cignus with surrounded in red the zone where it finds Cignus X 1 (the space is great excused for the lack of precision).  Cignux X 1 is a black hole discovered by a group of researchers (Charles Thomas Bolton). To discover it they observed a strong emanation of x-ray around a star. That emanation didn't make sense. Doppler technology and light variations proved that this star turned in a few days around something then unobservable emanating a lot of x-rays. This is the first time that the existence of a black hole has been proven. Until then it was a hypothetical phenomenon. The meaning 1 + 1 = 3 : x-ray + doppler = proof of the existence of a black hole !  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1  Juiced you win 9000 CTY + 2*1000 CTY = 11000 CTY for the two hint you shared with the comunity Congratulations again on your research work.
