I want to answer your questions step by step.  So, First there will be no Pre-ICO bonus or sales because we think that they are not useful furthermore generally Pre-ICO bonuses and sales decrease the coins or tokens value and credibility.  Second, on our platform the users will decide the price, there are two options, a teacher can decide how much USD they want and the system will automatically convert the amount into LIN token according to that day's market price or teacher can just say I want this much LIN token to give the lesson. The market price will refresh everyday, so there will be no gap or difference between the service price and market price.  Third, stock exchanges are the only place for stock holders to interact with their investments in many ICOs and projects, so this is an important issue. We think that the more a token traded in stock exchanges, the more reliable and fluid it is. Consequently we will apply all available stock exchanges and we will increase our accessibility too. In contrast of other ICOs we have another option for our investors. Academia Lingu will have a platform when the project starts, which means LIN token will be in use after the ICO. Later LIN token will be used as a currency between our business associates. This is the huge difference between our project and the other futuristic projects that has no real use.  Fourth, we are opening to public market place, so only assumption that we can make is the ICO price, which is 88.000 LIN token for 1 ETH, other than this assumption is not a truth. The market will decide the token cost.  Last but the most important question's answer is that, we are planning to use 5 billion LIN token with our business associates that we are going to settle and the other 5 billion will be used in stock exchanges, according to stock exchanges' rules there would be a difference but we are planning to release LIN tokens gradually and equally after the ICO in 24 months, day by day. Eventually there will be no sudden increase or decrease in stock exchanges. Our plan is following a linear method while we are opening to public.  Feel free to ask any questions.

As an English Instructor and a graduate from English Language Teaching Department I can tell that talking to a regular person and a teacher in terms of learning a language is completely two different things. While speaking to a teacher that is trying to teach a language, he/she makes you speak all the time without you realizing, watch your mistakes and correct them in a right way so that your motivation of learning doesn’t lost. These are just a few of many things that a teacher can provide you while speaking.  Other than that the platform doesn’t provide only speaking sessions but also provides grammar sessions. The platform itself tracks your learning progress and lets you know about your process. When you complete your grammar sessions, the platform also makes you take an efficiency test to determine if you are ready to move on. The platform also lets you follow current news and articles according to your language level. I hope the things I’ve written above are enough for you to understand that the project isn’t something that you can just use to have a chat with other people.",False
