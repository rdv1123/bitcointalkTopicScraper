Its aim is to reduce the costs associated with the search of the products at a low price.   Interesting enough! As you know, the world of finance shows the greatest interest in blockchain technology. However, the functionality of this distributed registry technology is much broader than the financial services industry and can be used not only in the banking sector but also in a number of other areas — to protect copyright and property rights, simplify cash payments, purchase of goods on the blockchain, for data management, mining and energy, digital identification, electronic voting, games, organizational management, on the Internet of things, the labor market, real estate and other areas.  Especially interesting is the use of blockchain technology in the industrial sector, as here it can solve many problems in the organization of production and sale of products. Supply chains of industrial enterprises are very complex mechanisms with their own nuances that can slow down and complicate many production and logistics processes.  The use of blockchain technology will simplify the process of spare parts replacement and purchase of new equipment for industrial companies, will make it possible to track all stages of delivery and get rid of bureaucracy, exclude the intermediary link from the chain and expand the list of customers, as well as establish direct communication with consumers.  Despite the fact that blockchain is still a relatively new technology which continues to develop, it has great prospects and is able to radically change the conduct of business by industrial companies.",True

This situation on the market has served as a basis for the emergence of our Yodse project, which has been developed by our professional team to provide direct communication between manufacturers and end users of industrial products. We strive to erase the boundaries as much as possible and reduce the distance between producers and buyers in the real sector of the economy, increase the efficiency of processes and businesses, making them as transparent as possible through the use of blockchain technology.  Yodse is a global ecosystem that establishes a direct link between producers and buyers of manufactured goods! Get to know our project on its official website https://yodse.io",True

Yodse is a global ecosystem that directly connects manufacturers and buyers of goods and is based on blockchain technology. In April 2018 the project has come to the Pre-ICO.  In 2017, the concept of yodse blockchain platform was developed. The project was originated by the creators of “VST” , a company specializing in international shipments of manufactured goods. Its employees, assessing the prospects of development, drew attention to the fact that today online sales are gaining popularity. Further analysis showed that in the online environment, the sale of industrial goods is associated with certain difficulties — there is no direct connection between the seller and the buyer, the cost of the goods is often overestimated, and the quality is mediocre.  According to experts, the best way to solve this problem will be to create a global ecosystem based on blockchain technologies. The creation and launch of the platform Yodse will allow you to solve the following tasks:  Communication without intermediaries-sellers and buyers can communicate directly. Reliability of information — decentralized storage of information ensures its inviolability and immutability. Security-it is guaranteed by smart contracts, encryption algorithms and hash functions. Openness-the information is publicly available and any member of the system can track the data of a block. For example, one user transferred $ 100 USD to another, everyone can follow the transaction. Another thing is that information about the parties to the transaction can only be opened by its participants. Creation of yodse ecosystem will allow to organize producers, buyers and service companies into a single community. To manage the system, a Web-interface and a mobile application are developed that will help the buyer to enter the online trading platform, where manufacturers, using a similar service, place offers of their goods and services. At the conclusion of the transaction the parties in real time stipulate its terms after which the buyer pays for the goods. Initially, the money debited from the purse of the buyer shall be credited to Yodse, the manufacturer, upon notice, ships the goods, delivered by transporting service company — a party of the system. Upon completion of the delivery, the logistics company sends a notification and the funds are credited to the seller’s account. The calculation can be carried out both in traditional and in virtual currency. In fact, yodse ecosystem contributes to the development of the industrial sector of the global economy, provoking a decline in the prices of such goods and improving their quality, which has a positive impact on the living standards of the population.

The first buyers of tokens in the period of pre-ICO and ICO to the amount of at least 1 000 USD are provided with an increased referral rate by 7% compared to the usual token holders. The referral fund of tokens in the amount of 10% of the total issued amount is locked until the 1 January 2019 (except referral payments within the period of pre-ICO and ICO),and further payments to the referrals will be available from the 1 January 2019 in accordance with the referral program.  The purchase of tokens at the early stages will allow purchasers and active holders to influence on the increase of token value, through the referral program. The referral program will be expanded and aimed exclusively at increasing the number of product manufacturers and customers on the marketplace and transactions in the Yodse ecosystem that will contribute to its expansion. These restrictions will not allow to collapse the token value on the stock exchange shortly after the ICO and will set limits to the appearance of a significant number of tokens publicly available on the exchange, as was the case with a large number of ICOs conducted. Thus, we take care that our token buyers funds won’t be affected by the actions of speculators manipulating sales in exchange trade. Moreover, lock of tokens due tothe Yodse team proves its interests and prospects for long-term work and successful implementation of the Yodse project.   Project team is interested in the successful implementation of all the activities and with a view to motivation we initially lock the payment of tokens to the Yodse project team in the following order: 50% of the tokens due to the team are paid after the ICO, and the second half is frozen and paid only after the 1 January 2020. Similarly, for the long-term motivation of consultants, tokens are paid in the following order:1/3 just after the successfully conducted ICO, 1/3 will be unlocked up to the 1 September 2018 and 1/3 up to the 1 January 2019.  We hope active participants of refferal program will undertand and accept that terms.  Our team is highly motivated to build successful, fast-growing Ecosystem.  Best regards, Alex Rvach",True

The first buyers of tokens in the period of pre-ICO and ICO to the amount of at least 1 000 USD are provided with an increased referral rate by 7% compared to the usual token holders. The referral fund of tokens in the amount of 10% of the total issued amount is locked until the 1 January 2019 (except referral payments within the period of pre-ICO and ICO),and further payments to the referrals will be available from the 1 January 2019 in accordance with the referral program.  The purchase of tokens at the early stages will allow purchasers and active holders to influence on the increase of token value, through the referral program. The referral program will be expanded and aimed exclusively at increasing the number of product manufacturers and customers on the marketplace and transactions in the Yodse ecosystem that will contribute to its expansion. These restrictions will not allow to collapse the token value on the stock exchange shortly after the ICO and will set limits to the appearance of a significant number of tokens publicly available on the exchange, as was the case with a large number of ICOs conducted. Thus, we take care that our token buyers funds won’t be affected by the actions of speculators manipulating sales in exchange trade. Moreover, lock of tokens due tothe Yodse team proves its interests and prospects for long-term work and successful implementation of the Yodse project.   Project team is interested in the successful implementation of all the activities and with a view to motivation we initially lock the payment of tokens to the Yodse project team in the following order: 50% of the tokens due to the team are paid after the ICO, and the second half is frozen and paid only after the 1 January 2020. Similarly, for the long-term motivation of consultants, tokens are paid in the following order:1/3 just after the successfully conducted ICO, 1/3 will be unlocked up to the 1 September 2018 and 1/3 up to the 1 January 2019.  We hope active participants of refferal program will undertand and accept that terms.  Our team is highly motivated to build successful, fast-growing Ecosystem.  Best regards, Alex Rvach",True

Blockchain in our project will make the relationship between buyer and seller as transparent as possible, will allow manufacturers and customers to communicate directly without intermediaries. Using Yodse tokens manufacturers will be able to save on the promotion of their business through the latest marketing technologies, encourage customer loyalty, enjoy all the privileges of the site, get new opportunities in the field of marketing and offer further ways to develop and improve the functioning of the platform. The functionality of our ecosystem will give new opportunities to small and medium-sized businesses to promote products and buyers will be given a wide range of products for which it is possible to pay in Fiat currency as well as in other cryptocurrencies.   We often talk about blockchain technology – it is not a secret to our subscribers that this technology will be used by us when creating Yodse platform. Today we have considered it necessary to tell you a little more about blockchain and how it can be used in our work. So, blockchain is an electronic registry technology that is used to record and store transaction data. The information is stored on the blockchain decentralized, distributed across the network nodes. It is virtually impossible to falsify the data stored in this way, which makes this method of fixing information transparent and as safe as possible. Initially, the blockchain was created to work with cryptocurrencies. Today, companies are exploring various possibilities of blockchain integration into all spheres, including industry and production. For example, IBM Blockchain improves the supply chain and manages data, Blockchain Foundry specializes in services for the production of industrial products, BigChain DB advertises scalable services, and Chain offers a platform for financial services. We are convinced that the integration of blockchain technology in the creation of our service will optimize all internal processes, make the communication of the buyer and the manufacturer more simple and transparent, save time and financial resources.",True

More than 41% of buyers are willing to buy the goods and services they need via the Internet, but only 19.3% of manufacturers use the Internet to sell their products, and the total production of manufactured goods is about 37 trillion US dollars. It is this market that Yodse service plans to enter! In the realities of the sovereign market, when the Internet has helped buyers become more aware, mobile and informed about products and services, Yodse will allow them to solve problems related to the purchase and sale of goods as efficiently as possible. Our service will take into account the client's need for personalization, will provide them with a wide range of products and services, will help to objectively decide on the purchase through a unique feedback system and a transparent rating system.
