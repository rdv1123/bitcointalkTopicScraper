In an online course on YouTube, the expert focused on how some applications could benefit the industry by bringing a new level of efficiency to their markets. Nick believes there is one particular startup, Pavo, that can bring fresh solutions by allowing farmers to sell futures of their products.  It shouldn’t come as a surprise that agriculture is a $5 trillion industry that employs over a billion people around the world. However, it can be a thankless business for some of its most important value creators. In the agriculture supply chain, farmers and growers are generally left in the position of price takers, not price setters. This is due to many complex economic factors ranging from economies of scale to general inefficiencies in supply and demand.  A simple to understand fact is that the results of a farmer’s output are generally seen months after the first seed is planted. Given the situation, a farmer always works to provide an uncertain supply to an uncertain demand....",False

They’re constantly rising. Blockchain could eliminate paper-based processes and cut costs, with these savings passed on to you.  Getting rid of middlemen would minimize transaction fees, and decentralization would also make it easier for smaller farms to compete with larger corporations. For example, blockchain concepts such as PavoCoin are entering the fray — giving smaller farmers access to attainable financial services, such as the ability to pre-sell crops via smart contracts, helping them to improve the quality and quantity of their harvests, and providing consumers with greater amounts of information about the food they are buying. The company says, farmers in Stockton and in Dixon, California, have recently started using the system. A third installation is planned in Merced soon.  Optimizing farming would empower farmers of all scales with the information, resources and security they need to have higher yields, more lucrative crops. This would drive prices down for the average consumer and increase accessibility to higher quality goods. Higher yields also pump more money into the agricultural ecosystem, increasing the availability of farmed goods.",False

The CEO, Allan Young, was also part of the KYC Legal project.  Closed KYC Legal  ICO on April 1 2018; lights turned out July 2, 2018.   Click on the Telegram link for KYC Legal and it returns word scam.  Go to KYC Legal webpage and look for social media links.  They are gone.  But you can find Mr. Young's name on the earliest of advertisements for KYC Legal.   During the time he was an advisor, days after the ICO closed, he did not tell anybody the chief business officer had quit.  Nor did explain any other the other actions.   20+ Million dollars were burned in 2 months or this was a scam.  Even as just a human being in this group, you give a friendly.  Much more is expected if you put your face on an ICO from investors.  At the very least a written statement.  If you invest in AgTech, perhaps it is legit, you should get an answer why Allan Young said nothing when KYC Legal turned off the lights.  He had a duty to investors if he represented the company, even only to glorify his resume with his name and resume on another ICO.   People make mistakes but people also do the right thing.   In this case, there is no evidence at all that Mr. Young did anything as simple as provide a response to investors left high and dry.  Do you really want to invest with someone with this track record.    I  am only suggesting this guy has red flags in terms of credibility for a recent ICO and you due diligence should be to ask hard questions.   Ask them what their duties are and their promises to investors.   They are selling securities and should provide you the basic info like addresses, transparency, is their a partial refund of remaining funds if the ICO goes bust.  And get it in writing.  Make sure you download the white paper and save it.   Make sure the white paper tells you exactly what they are going to do with your money and what they will do to give tokens.

Farmers are eager to adopt new farming techniques, and many are willing to implement new innovations in AgTech to help them meet demand. Fortunately, the outlook for contemporary farming practices has just improved, as Pavo, the IoT blockchain solution for the AgTech ecosystem, accelerates the roll-out their technology on farms in the US.

Turkey holds a special place in the hearts and minds of the founders and developers of Pavocoin AG, provider of an IoT blockchain solution for the AgTech ecosystem, with offices in Zug, Switzerland, and San Francisco, California. There is a special connection between the almond and walnut farms and farmers of the California Central Valley, and the hazelnut and almond farms and farmers of Turkey.  As Pavo’s groundbreaking technology is now being rolled out around the world, they aim to apply what they learned from working with Turkish hazelnut farmers and California almond farmers to unite traditional farm practices with the latest in AI, blockchain technology, and analytical science. The company believes that, coupled with the traditional wisdom of local farmers, their innovative IoT and blockchain platform will play a leading role in helping the entire agricultural sector meet the growing demands of an increasing global population.  Hazelnuts are an important crop for the Turkish economy, accounting for 75% of the world market in 2016 according to recent data. Agriculture itself plays a significant role in the Turkish economy overall, making up over 6% of their GDP, while 20% of the country’s working population is employed in the agricultural sector. It’s a USD 52 billion industry that has grown 40% from 2002 to 2016. In 2014, extreme weather ravaged the hazelnut crop, however, leading to a 60% price increase in world hazelnut prices. A crop failure of that magnitude can have devastating effects on an economy like Turkey’s, and smaller growers and producers were particularly hard hit. Pavocoin has developed a system that could help farmers of any scale track and analyze every step of the growing process, from seed to harvest to delivery, in a quest to predict and adjust for local growing conditions.  The company accomplishes this by analyzing present-day conditions along with 10-year data tracking, which they argue offers more accurate predictive models than using simple retrospective analysis alone. Pavocoin Co-Founder and Vice-Chairman Allan Young explains, “By bringing the cutting-edge technologies of IoT and blockchain, as well as Pavo’s vast experience in crop cultivation, to Turkey, Pavo is fostering an agricultural ecosystem focused on highly technologized crop growing, processing and distribution.”  Young adds, “Our platform tracks the information and uses it to optimize the whole growing cycle by ensuring that vital crop measurements stay within optimal ranges. Our data scientists have done predictive modeling that shows significant yield increases can be achieved, regardless of crop, through the implementation of Pavo.”  Indeed, Pavo’s data scientists have constructed a yield estimator for Turkish farmers that can predict outcomes for each individual hazelnut tree in a given zone. The company’s preliminary results indicate that their system has the capability to use existing environmental conditions to extract estimates of crop outcomes. The technology is being designed to be a complete system that can be implemented by a farmer of any size. This is crucial in an economy like Turkey’s agricultural sector, where smaller farmers need to have access to vital new technologies so they can stay competitive in a globalized market.  Pavo’s web- and mobile-driven platform brings together everything the AgTech ecosystem needs, including remote recording, reporting, and analysis of all growing activities from planting to spraying records to shipping conditions and delivery. Everything is tracked, can be analyzed on the fly, and adjustments can be made as needed by the grower. The blockchain component of their system enables secure transactions and payments, smart contracts, and cashless transactions, and it’s all done from one user-friendly platform.  The company has just recently concluded phase one of the public presale of their PAVO ICO. The utility token is what drives the various functionalities of the platform. Phase two of their presale is now active and offers a 33% bonus until August 6, when their main sale will begin. The main sale will continue until September 15, 2018, with various decreasing bonuses offered throughout. https://medium.com/@PavoIoT/how-turkeys-hazelnuts-helped-pavo-create-the-technology-that-will-drive-the-global-agricultural-8c049cdde9be",False

Their proposal was to provide a super simple exchange factor from cryptocurrency to actual marijuana for specific strains of marijuana and cannabis preparations. For example, you can exchange CANN at a rate of 1 coin for 1 gram. They are a leader in the cannabis industry, but so far there are no specific expansion plans on the company's website. The difference is that PAVO not only allows quick, secure digital payments between all members of the community, it has also developed an IoT platform that helps growers to improve the quality of cannabis and to reduce production costs. There are a number of companies in the cannabis industry that play around the edges of what we do, for example, Paragon, but no other company provides a platform to manage cannabis growth and distribution from “seed to smoke.” Pavo’s cloud-computing based platform and leading edge IoT technology enable real-time management of gardens, ensuring the highest yield of the highest quality product, while ensuring regulatory compliance, sustainable business practices, and honest, fair play within the cannabis ecosystem. Pavo also provides a private cryptocurrency specifically for the cannabis industry, to alleviate the dangers of dealing in cash. The PAVO coin is a secure, reliable, safe payment instrument The main difference between PAVO and Pot Coin is that our project is based on a high-tech, high-quality product. Pavo provides an intelligent state-of-the-art IoT blockchain platform for industry participants to manage their business from seed to consumption. For example, Pavo enables growers to make smarter, faster agricultural and business decisions based on real data.  But no solution for whole agricultural ecosystem is in development yet, as far as our analytics has researched the market (deep enough )",False

These are: changes in the legal status of the cannabis industry, including political and economic risks, emergence of new players with the same product, and technical failure. None of these are likely to happen for the following reasons. The legal status of cannabis is showing a strong trend toward full legalization for recreational, medical, and industrial use. Given the ongoing political situation in the U.S. and other countries, all the stakeholders in power in the markets which look interesting for us are in favor of full legalization. This trend and its acceleration make the rollback of legalization of the cannabis industry not just improbable, but most surely impossible. As for new players who may try to capture the market in which we work and are planning to expand, our experience, team, and know-how make us not just competitive, but guarantee our leadership in this industry. As for technical failure - the blockchain technology, in association with the Internet of Things, has proved itself to be a safe, faultless, and hack-free system in a number of industries.

Given the ongoing political situation in the U.S. and other countries, all the stakeholders in power in the markets which look interesting for us are in favor of full legalization. This trend and its acceleration make the rollback of legalization of the cannabis industry not just improbable, but most surely impossible.

Right now, the IoT software component exists and is deployed at two cannabis grow houses in California, USA.  The PavoCoin (PAVO) is a cryptocurrency payment system that enables agriculture market participants, such as growers, producers, innovators, retailers and service providers in our network to accept digital payments from their customers and community members. PAVO is a functional usage coin. PAVO facilitates transactions among ecosystem participants and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional payment instruments like cash or credit cards. This mitigates both security risks and risks due to a nationally-chartered financial institution shutting down an account. Our mission is to offer a multi-purpose blockchain focusing on value exchange that maximizes the total value for all stakeholders. We are actively developing cutting-edge usage token functionality and wallet features such as recurring payments, proof-of-receipt and exclusive escrow for future exchanges of value provided directly to a PAVO wallet after payment.
