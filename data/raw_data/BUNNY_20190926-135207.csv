These method is MyEtherWallet website analogue. It works the following way: There is a cryptocurrency node for Etherium. So the node is the distribution programm packages which are provided by ETH developers. Any website including BunnyToken refers to that node by API to transfer transaction which afterwards sends to blockchain. On the moment of sending the transaction from website to the node it is necessary to sign up the transaction by your private key. Transaction is signed and send. During this process your private key is not sending anywhere and the transaction is sending already encrypted. This way of payment is made for your convenience and Bunny account don't save your private key as well as any other keys. The account is only the tool for displaying of wallets ballances and a guide for token purchasing.,False
