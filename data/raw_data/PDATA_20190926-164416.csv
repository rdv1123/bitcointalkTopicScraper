This will lead to more sustainability and an increase in the number of customers. Besides strengthening the existing product solution we are further working on our web-eye tracking and web-emotion recognition solution. We plan to provide you a great video that shows the capability of the current prototype early year.    Regarding listing and exchanges: we do have listing agreements signed with 5 exchanges so far including high ranked exchanges on CMC and Coinhills. Besides that we have a powerful listing strategy and campaign prepared that we will execute once the crypto market gets friendlier.

A very reasonable question. now to answer that, PDATA’s trading of personal data is based on the blockchain. Blockchains were built to function in a “trustless” environment in which people can transact directly with one another without needing to trust any middleman in the ecosystem. The blockchain technology and the PDATA platform ensure following (these are also GDPR requirements): 1.     The consumer owns the personal data and has full control over it. 2.     Personal data never leaves the consumer in an unencrypted format and only the consumer holds the key to decrypt it. 3.     Personal data can only be transferred to a company with the consumer’s consent. In addition to that the consumer knows exactly who gets the data and for what purpose. 4.     The trading of personal data is fully transparent and traceable on the blockchain whereby the anonymity of the trading parties is completely protected.

The Opiria Platform was created as a response to an established desire amongst consumers to have greater control over their personal data, and keep it secure.

Here's an update pertaining your question:  The consumer can choose any time to delete all his data that is stored on the opiria platform. For the data that has been exchanged for PDATA tokens with companies, the process is as follows: the consumers are well informed to whom they give the data and what is the intended purpose of usage of this data, as well as the usage period. If the consumer agrees to this, he gets the PDATA tokens in return and the data is handed over to the company that bought it. All this is happening through the blockchain and explained into more detail here: https://medium.com/pdata-token/enabling-gdpr-compliant-trading-of-personal-data-on-the-blockchain-2086e7585be0. There is no undo function on the blockchain. The company gets the data and can use it and the consumer gets the PDATA tokens. We might think of a possibility of revoking the contract, case in which the tokens get back to the company and the company agrees not to use the data. But this cannot be ensured through the blockchain since the company already has the data of the user.  Hope this helps answer your question",False

Blockchains were built to function in a “trustless” environment in which people can transact directly with one another without needing to trust any middleman in the ecosystem. The blockchain technology and the PDATA platform ensure following (these are also GDPR requirements): 1.     The consumer owns the personal data and has full control over it. 2.     Personal data never leaves the consumer in an unencrypted format and only the consumer holds the key to decrypt it. 3.     Personal data can only be transferred to a company with the consumer’s consent. In addition to that the consumer knows exactly who gets the data and for what purpose. 4.     The trading of personal data is fully transparent and traceable on the blockchain whereby the anonymity of the trading parties is completely protected.",False

PDATA’s trading of personal data is based on the blockchain. Blockchains were built to function in a “trustless” environment in which people can transact directly with one another without needing to trust any middleman in the ecosystem. The blockchain technology and the PDATA platform ensure following (these are also GDPR requirements): 1.     The consumer owns the personal data and has full control over it. 2.     Personal data never leaves the consumer in an unencrypted format and only the consumer holds the key to decrypt it. 3.     Personal data can only be transferred to a company with the consumer’s consent. In addition to that the consumer knows exactly who gets the data and for what purpose. 4.     The trading of personal data is fully transparent and traceable on the blockchain whereby the anonymity of the trading parties is completely protected.  Also , in light of this discussion there was an article on BV world e-magazine titled ""Business Vision – Spring 2018"". Where Mark Zuckerberg and our CEO, Christian Lange are on the same page !!

In the existing market, personal data is often obtained through dishonest practices, and consumers are not compensated.

This is achieved by discounting the middleman involved in the regular format of the industry. The companies pays directly to the consumers for their data they provide, hence generating  a passive income to the consumer. Plus since the companies have to pay via PDATA , they need to acquire the tokens to buy the data from the consumers , hence creasing a demand and supply routine. So the tokens also in turn contribute to motivate people to join  Hope this answers",False

While it may seem this way at first, what you have to remember about the Opiria-platform, is that rather than an intermediary service, like a data broker, the platform is rather a tool to equip its users to facilitate their own transactions.  Whatever operating fees are associated with the transactions will be minimal, and instead of crooked data brokers profiting from consumer's personal data, the consumer is the direct recipient of that income  The interface of the app is an enabler, putting the consumer in a fair position to authorize how they want their data used, allows them to generate a passive income, and devalues the product of brokers violating personal privacy  .  I hope this answers your question.",False

Today data brokers are making big money with our personal data.”  Lange is the CEO and founder of Opiria, a German-based firm that buys consumer data from individuals and markets it to Big Business.

That is a good question. I personally believe that the benefits that the consumer receives are just one of the main features of the PDATA platform that makes it different:  Consumers will have full control over the collection and usage of their personal data. Consumers can control with whom they share their personal data. Consumers get proper compensation for the provided personal data. Personal data flows directly from consumers to companies with no middleman  Beyond the consumer, it is the Tech that PDATA are moving towards that is special. With version 2.0 the PDATA platform will also allow researchers to run web browser based surveys. The Opiria eye tracking browser plugin will measure consumer's gaze behavior when looking at stimuli (e.g. videos or pictures: embedded in a survey or when browsing the internet, playing games or interacting with software. At the same time the Opiria emotion analysis browser plugin will measure consumer emotions by looking at their facial expressions.",False

This puts data in a more or less redundant state and guess what? Only the user has the key to decrypt the data. Again, consent of user is sought before all data exchange transactions are initiated. What's more, transaction is carried directly between user and company.  We know that data isn't corrupt as consumers are very well aware they're are going to be incentivized with tokens for releasing data and again, they release data at their own free will.  Most data brokers don't seek consent of personal data owners before trading their data which means data owners don't get compensated for their traded data.  PDATA on their other hand makes sure data trading is carried out directly between user and company. User can choose to release his data or not upon receiving a request from a company. Most amazing part is consumers are rewarded with PDATA tokens which can be traded for fiat currency like USD for selling their data. ",False

Blockchains were built to function in a “trustless” environment in which people can transact directly with one another without needing to trust any middleman in the ecosystem. The blockchain technology and the PDATA platform ensure following (these are also GDPR requirements): 1.     The consumer owns the personal data and has full control over it. 2.     Personal data never leaves the consumer in an unencrypted format and only the consumer holds the key to decrypt it. 3.     Personal data can only be transferred to a company with the consumer’s consent. In addition to that the consumer knows exactly who gets the data and for what purpose. 4.     The trading of personal data is fully transparent and traceable on the blockchain whereby the anonymity of the trading parties is completely protected.  Hope this solves your question",False

The advertising industry is massive and will stand to benefit greatly from the kind of data targeting that the Opiria-Platform will allow them access too.

Opiria’s concept is to store cleartext information of just proof of the existence of data, as well as some information about the data. The platform cannot access the personal data of the consumers by itself. It can only access profile information of the consumers. That enables companies to filter for consumer profiles and datasets they are interested in.  The question of where the data is stored then arises. The original unencrypted data never leaves the storage of its owner, that is usually the device on which the data was sourced (e.g. the user´s smartphone). Whenever data has to leave this device, it is encrypted.  You can keep up to date on new developments by joining the Telegram announcement channel: https://t.me/PDATAannouncements ",False

The GDPR is binding for any company that stores or processes personal data or information about EU citizens within the EU states even if they don't have a business presence in the EU. “Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.  How Opiria fulfills the requirements of GDPR:  The following points are ways the Opiria-platform fulfills the GDPR requirements regarding privacy and protection of personal data.  1. Consent as lawful basis for processing  2 . Security of processing and pseudonymisation  3. Right of access, transparency and processing purpose  4. Right to rectification, to erasure and data portability  5. Records of processing activities  6.

PDATA’s trading of personal data is based on the blockchain. Blockchains were built to function in a “trust less” environment in which people can transact directly with one another without needing to trust any middleman in the ecosystem. The blockchain technology and the PDATA platform ensure following (these are also GDPR requirements): 1.     The consumer owns the personal data and has full control over it. 2.     Personal data never leaves the consumer in an unencrypted format and only the consumer holds the key to decrypt it. 3.     Personal data can only be transferred to a company with the consumer’s consent. In addition to that the consumer knows exactly who gets the data and for what purpose. 4.     The trading of personal data is fully transparent and traceable on the blockchain whereby the anonymity of the trading parties is completely protected.  Hope this answers your question 😄",False

The blockchain technology and the PDATA platform ensure following (these are also GDPR requirements): 1.     The consumer owns the personal data and has full control over it. 2.     Personal data never leaves the consumer in an unencrypted format and only the consumer holds the key to decrypt it. 3.     Personal data can only be transferred to a company with the consumer’s consent. In addition to that the consumer knows exactly who gets the data and for what purpose. 4.
