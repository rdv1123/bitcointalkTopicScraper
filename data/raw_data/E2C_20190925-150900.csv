E2C is built according to the ERC-20 token standards, which is used by the popular Ethereum system. This makes E2C compliant with most cryptocurrencies standards and protocols in the market, hence more compatible with most trading platforms.  At E2C, we look to an ecological and sustainable future. Our project will build towards an energy revolution, a more equitable distribution of energy, and improved control over the use and transaction of energy.  Conventionally, the energy market is dominated by large power plants, with control being centralized in a few people. This often results in large excessive costs for the ordinary people, such as owners of private enterprises who are dependent on energy.  With a decentralized structure as our cornerstone, a fairer environment and terms can be created for the masses, allowing small energy producers to sell their own energy at a significantly increased profit, and for everyone to save money when buying it. This is our core market, normal everyday people like you and me, who are either already consumers of energy, or small-scale producers.  Through the E2C platform, tokens can be freely traded and exchanged for energy. These tokens, known as E2C tokens, transcend geographical and temporal barriers, increasing its efficiency and profitability of use. Through blockchain peer-to-peer technology, usage of our tokens are secure, anonymous, and decentralized. We make everything convenient for our partners by developing applications concurrently for both mobile and desktop. Additionally, E2C also provide people a solution to produce energy efficiently with lower cost using our patented new solar panel technology.  Ultimately, we want E2C to bring the developm ent of lasting energy solutions.",False

After you contact Malaysian Authorities you will see not only they do not have any license but also the Malaysian Authorities will ask you to provide them with info. about any activity of creator academy, simply because everything they do is not legal. They design websites and make people believe that the website belongs to a company that is among the best in the world! and make people invest in that company's projects through a referral program which is a pyramid scheme. if you invest and bring more investors to the project then the reward is a percentage! after a while people found out the websites are designed by creator academy and there was NO company at all, or the company existed but only as a name and a website with absolutely no documentation. The very obvious reason is that creator academy claimed Unifunds was an international company and it was among the best in the world and was to be listed soon!

My name is Kate.  I have been studying E2C, It's an amazing project aiming to be a gateway for energy trades specially electricity. I believe thats enough for it to make it stands out of the crowd.  We are Lucky to be one of first group to own these tokens, as the price of it will skyrocket once energy agencies start to use this gateway. E2C its fast, secure and by the help of POS mining system it will be even more exiting to work with, POS is an eco-friendly system which consume very little electricity in compare to POW system. (i believe all coins will be joining POS system soon)  if you guys want to keep tracking of this project its much easier to own an account (which is free) in E2C website. but as long as company using affiliate program, an invitation link will be needed. feel free to use the link below. If you want to own E2C tokens you can use BTC or ETH deposit after you get your account. but you gotta be quick before the low price sold out.     https://electronicenergycoin.com/register?ref=kat70770",False

Hi first of all sorry for me bad english Second I want to clear up something. For those who dont khnow....there is a company that create e2c ""Worldwide.energy"".it says it works on renewable energy. You could and still can invest in this company with atleast 10% benefit monthly. But of course you cant just regiter in their site.only someone who regitered before could bring you in.  In past few years it gave the benefit to members by dollar. Last year it announced that company decided to have their own coin to help the world with buying or selling energy. When they launch e2c suddenly they cut off the payment of benefit to members. They decided on their own that change the benefit from dollar to e2c and they set the 1 e2c equal to 1 dollar. I urge you guys to google worldwide.energy. and of course with a dot before energy word. Thats the story of e2c. I am one of those members.I bring someones with me in.someones who have illness and MS.... God help them.
