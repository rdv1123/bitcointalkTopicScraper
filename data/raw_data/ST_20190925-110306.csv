Currently Science output is controlled by some major players in the industry which is really keeping Science from achieving it`s true potential.  As a currency it also works to revolutionize how funding is gathered, by implementing a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm you will be able to support science with the transaction fees gathered from the network. This will allow us to create a brand new funding source and support Science in developing countries.  Another feature which also benefits from a cryptocurrency is our decentralized scientific marketplace which will allow scientists and researchers from all around the world to exchange services and equipment regardless of their location.",False
