In the process of discussing the main anonymous purse for the crypto currency ""Stealth Wallet"", a request was issued for the transfer of crypto-currency with unknown even to the sender with the final address of the recipient. Certainly in ""Stealth Wallet"" will be implemented several mechanisms that allow you to transmit crypto currency without knowing the final destination address. We remind you that the development of Stealth Wallet is already underway.  1. The system of ""vouchers""    Stealth voucher is essentially the code that the user acquires inside the Stealth system. Stealth voucher is designed to be given. As a matter of fact it is a question of one more way of transfer of money from a purse on a purse. A distinctive feature of this transfer of funds is that it is possible to present such a gift anonymously. The user who will be addressed to this gift to receive money will be enough to activate the voucher. The money received in this way can be spent for almost any purpose.  STEALTH vouchers can be used for the following purposes: Pay for services or goods; Withdraw from the wallet; Transfer to another user of the service.        That is, after the activation of STEALTH vouchers are converted into electronic money in your wallet and you can use them as well as funds that have been credited to your account in the usual way. The commission is not charged for the activation of vouchers. The user will receive exactly as much as he was sent. The commission will be withheld when buying a voucher.     To give Stealth vouchers you can even not registered in STEALTH person. However, to take advantage of the money you have to create a purse in the Stealth system.  2. System ""Force Majeure""     Sometimes there are situations when you need to hide funds urgently and directly at a time when you are under direct supervision. To do this, Stealth Wallet will implement a force majeure system.  How it works:     When you open the wallet ""Stealth Wallet"" user specifies an alphanumeric combination that will be known only to him. Later on, in the purse ""Stealth Wallet"", the user himself determines a secret ""button"" by clicking on which all funds from all wallets go to the wallets located on the servers of the system. These funds will be used later in the mix of coins. To restore the funds in full (minus the commission for the operation), you can simply enter an alphanumeric combination, determined in advance by the user. The funds are written off instantly and unnoticed by an outside observer. When recovered, funds are transferred from other, operational wallets of the ""Stealth Wallet"" system, and in fact this operation is an instant mix of available funds. This operation can not be tracked by existing means of objective control.  3. Built-in system of ""aliases""    Each user will have a unique name assigned to him at registration. In ""Stealth Wallet"" will be implemented a system similar to the social network. That is, users can add each other ""to friends"" and chat in private chats inside the system. Within the framework of this system, it will be sufficient to know the username for sending funds. The blocking address for sending funds in this way will not be needed. It will be sufficient to specify the user name in the column ""recipient"".  4.  Cross-currency transfer:    To break the chain of transfers inside the blockchain, it will be enough to transfer funds with the exchange of one currency to another.   Example:   The sender sends bitcoin and the recipient in turn receives lightcore or ether or any other currency that is supported by ""Stealth Wallet"". In this case, a direct link can not be tracked.      The Stealth Project team is constantly in close contact with its subscribers and will constantly upgrade and improve its products in accordance with the changing objective situation. Also for individual projects, it is possible to implement exclusive versions of ""Stealth Wallet"" adapted for specific purposes and tasks. Any options are possible up to integration of the payment gateway *  * Specifies individually  `Stealth Wallet Website`",False

We apologize for the small confusion in terms and prices of our ICO. The matter is that the Stealth project is carried out exclusively on own means and means of private investors. It is made first of all that our product was really anonymous. Accordingly, due to the large (for us) number of participants  and those wishing we missed the point that some pre-ICO participants set themselves the goal of instant enrichment that would hurt other investors. Because of this, there was a tense situation related to the possible speculation of our STELZ token. In this regard, we extend the term of the ICO and change the pricing policy downward. Henceforth, the timing and price of ICO will look like this: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-ICO stage - from June 1 to June 13, 2018. Cost of 1 STELZ = 0.1 $ min purchase from 1000 $ 1 round ICO from June 13 to June 30 Cost 1 STELZ = 0.12 $ min purchase from 12 $ 2 round ICO from July 1 to July 22 Cost 1 STELZ = 0.14 $ min purchase from $ 14 Round 3 ICO from July 23 to August 19 Cost 1 STELZ = 0.16 $ min purchase from $ 16 4 round ICO from August 20 to September 1, 2018 * Cost 1 STELZ = 0.20 $ min buy from $ 20 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  * Once all tokens intended for sale are implemented, the ICO will in fact be completed. The road map of the project remains unchanged. The bounty award will be paid on time. From July 1 begins the full development of Stealth Wallet. We also reserve the right to redeem 1 000 000 STELZ at a price of $ 0.5 from November 1 to December 1, 2018, however, now any STELZ token holder can participate on this date. Winners will be determined randomly using the lottery. The winners will be redeemed token STELZ price of $ 0.5 per piece (in the event that the owner himself wants it) All of the above changes are final. All information will be changed on our website stealthwallet.pro and in White Paper. Thank you for being with us. Let's make the internet really anonymous. Sincerely yours Stealth Project.",False
