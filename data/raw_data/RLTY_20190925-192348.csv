Yes, smart contracts are legally enforceable. Any type of contract or agreement is enforceable so long as it doesn't contain illegal terms and conditions. In case of dispute, what matters is what can be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. In the case of a smart contract, that's pretty much everything that was agreed upon, as well as all payments made (or not made), etc.  If people stop paying rent, you follow the proper termination of tenancy procedures and, if necessary, eviction procedures, for that particular jurisdiction. Our SMARTRealty contracts can even be pre-programmed to serve notice via email, so long as both parties agree to receive notice in that manner, so it can handle the termination procedure automatically. However, if a court-ordered eviction is necessary, then the landlord would still have to pursue that via the local court system, but the smart contract would provide all the evidence needed to make it a much easier process.",False

This is an ERC20 token, so if you're talking about a wallet, you can use any wallet that supports such tokens. If you are referring to the actual SMARTRealty contract and listing platforms, our focus will initially be on web based platforms, as well as Android and iPhone apps, so no Windows phone version is planned at this time, unless we see a demand for it.  Quote Really unique concept, going to follow it closely and see if everything works out. Was there something that pushed you to think of such concept?  The primary motivator for this project was all of us participating in both the crypto world as well as real estate investing. It's easy to see the many ways that cryptocurrency and smart contract technology can improve the real estate industry, especially in terms of agreements, rentals, sales, and dispute resolutions. We developed these solutions as a result of problems we see and experience ourselves, in our own day to day real estate dealings.  Quote Hi, Im interested in currency that you accept as a payment to buy your tokens. Can you tell me about it?  Right now, we accept BTC and ETH. You can buy the token direct from our website.

I will also post it here, and it will be added to the website shortly as well. The FAQ will expand as we receive more and more questions from everyone.   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  How does the SMARTRealty and RLTY token system work?  The SMARTRealty system has three primary elements:  1) The SMARTRealty contract platform – The contract platform consists of a template system that allows contract creators to create their own SMARTRealty smart contract that fits the needs of their specific transaction and complies with local statutes for their jurisdiction.  2) The SMARTRealty listing platforms – The SMARTRealty listing platforms will allow property owners to list their properties for rent or for sale, and will distribute these listings to many other popular real estate sale and rental sites all across the web.  3) RLTY Tokens – RLTY Tokens are the official SMARTRealty token for use with SMARTRealty smart contracts. Payments can be made with any major currency (crypto and fiat), but will be automatically converted to RLTY tokens so payments are properly recorded and tracked.  What will drive demand for the RLTY tokens beyond the ICO?  As mentioned above, RLTY Tokens are the official SMARTRealty token for use with SMARTRealty smart contracts. Payments can be made with any major currency (crypto and fiat), but will be automatically converted to RLTY tokens so payments are properly recorded and tracked. Since every transaction on our platforms, even payments made with fiat, will be converted to RLTY tokens, there will be a constant demand for RLTY tokens with many purchases occurring automatically as every transaction is converted. While the market exchanges will determine the value of RLTY at any given time, we believe the consistent usage of the utility token will keep demand high. It is important to reiterate, however, that the SMARTRealty team cannot guarantee or control future token values, and makes no guarantee or assurances in that regard.  Is there a minimum purchase for RLTY tokens?  There is no minimum purchase for participation.  What is the ICO soft cap and hard cap?  We have no soft cap at all. Regardless of the amount of funds raised, this project will move forward and development is already well underway. The hardcap for the ICO is 160,000 ETH but we do not expect to raise that much. Any unsold RLTY tokens allocated for the ICO will be destroyed at the end of the ICO period.  Will SMARTRealty’s contract and listing platforms be available worldwide?  Initially, we will launch in select test markets in the US. From there, we plan to expand to cover all of North America, and then the rest of the world soon after. We have to launch in phases, because every state, province, country, etc. has unique laws and unique elements that should be present in contracts in the respective jurisdictions. This requires consulting with attorneys in every location in order to ensure that contracts created on our platform are enforceable and legal in the jurisdiction where the property is located.  How do I see my RLTY Tokens in an ERC20 compatible wallet, like MyEtherWallet?  Add a custom token, and use the following info:  Contract Address: 0xbe99B09709fc753b09BCf557A992F6605D5997B0  Token Symbol: RLTY  Decimals: 8",False

Our rental platform will be launched first. If you're a rental agent, this would definitely appeal to your clients, both landlords and tenants. It's a blockchain-solidified smart contract solution that cannot be amended (without both parties agreeing) or forged, so all contracts are, for lack of a better phrase, ""set in stone"". Additionally, it can save landlords time and effort, by being pre-programmed to issue notices (for termination, breach of contract, late payments, nonpayments, etc.), as well as make dispute resolution a lot easier and offer the tenants an easy way to make their payments, using whatever currency they choose, be it crypto or fiat.  After the rental platform comes the owner-financed sales and FSBO platform, where our system likely creates the greatest benefit, allowing people to handle their own p2p sales and transfers with a lot less effort than current methods.  The sales platform comes in 2019, so if you're a buyer/seller agent, that platform will make the P&S process much simpler, as well as make the title and escrow process a bit smoother.  In addition to the above, all of our platforms allow buyers and tenants to make payments with whatever type of currency they prefer, be it cryptocurrency or fiat, and record the payments on the blockchain for permanent record. The SMARTRealty smart contracts can also simplify the escrow process, and secure security deposits and other funds for specific purposes.  The benefit for RLTY tokens and the holders of tokens is that all of these transactions, even those made in fiat, will automatically be converted to RLTY tokens in order to pay into the smart contract and have all payments recorded on the blockchain, so there will be a constant demand for RLTY tokens, even if the landlord or sellers prefer to be paid out in fiat, requiring RLTY tokens to be converted back into the currency of their choice eventually. So long as the contracts are in use, the underlying (and often automated) demand for RLTY continues.  Our platforms also integrate with pre-existing listing platforms, so our users won't need to skip over things like the MLS listing services, the various rental listing platforms, even Craigslist and the like. Our platforms will integrate fully with these other platforms, allowing listings on our platforms to also be listed on the most popular listing platforms and systems on the web. Landlords and sellers can simply input all of their property information on our platform and automatically have it listed on 100's of other sites, networks, and listing services.  Our goal here is not to replace existing systems, but to compliment them and eliminate some of the most common points of dispute, saving all parties a lot of headaches. We don't look to eliminate the existing processes, just disrupt them, but in ways that benefit everyone involved, from real estate agents to escrow companies, landlords to tenants, buyers to sellers, and more.  Beyond 2019, we plan to also introduce the SMARTMortgage platform, launching a smart contract and RLTY token-based lending platform that facilitates cryptocurrency based mortgages and lending on real property.  There's a lot of benefit to this project in the long run as well as the short term, and we are already hard at work bringing it to life.",False

The SMARTRealty system has three primary elements:  1) The SMARTRealty contract platform – The contract platform consists of a template system that allows contract creators to create their own SMARTRealty smart contract that fits the needs of their specific transaction and complies with local statutes for their jurisdiction.  2) The SMARTRealty listing platforms – The SMARTRealty listing platforms will allow property owners to list their properties for rent or for sale, and will distribute these listings to many other popular real estate sale and rental sites all across the web.  3) RLTY Tokens – RLTY Tokens are the official SMARTRealty token for use with SMARTRealty smart contracts. Payments can be made with any major currency (crypto and fiat), but will be automatically converted to RLTY tokens so payments are properly recorded and tracked.  What will drive demand for the RLTY tokens beyond the ICO?  As mentioned above, RLTY Tokens are the official SMARTRealty token for use with SMARTRealty smart contracts. Payments can be made with any major currency (crypto and fiat), but will be automatically converted to RLTY tokens so payments are properly recorded and tracked. Since every transaction on our platforms, even payments made with fiat, will be converted to RLTY tokens, there will be a constant demand for RLTY tokens with many purchases occurring automatically as every transaction is converted. While the market exchanges will determine the value of RLTY at any given time, we believe the consistent usage of the utility token will keep demand high. It is important to reiterate, however, that the SMARTRealty team cannot guarantee or control future token values, and makes no guarantee or assurances in that regard.  Is there a minimum purchase for RLTY tokens?  There is no minimum purchase for participation.  What is the ICO soft cap and hard cap?  We have no soft cap at all. Regardless of the amount of funds raised, this project will move forward and development is already well underway. The hardcap for the ICO is 160,000 ETH but we do not expect to raise that much. Any unsold RLTY tokens allocated for the ICO will be destroyed at the end of the ICO period.  Will SMARTRealty’s contract and listing platforms be available worldwide?  Initially, we will launch in select test markets in the US. From there, we plan to expand to cover all of North America, and then the rest of the world soon after. We have to launch in phases, because every state, province, country, etc. has unique laws and unique elements that should be present in contracts in the respective jurisdictions. This requires consulting with attorneys in every location in order to ensure that contracts created on our platform are enforceable and legal in the jurisdiction where the property is located.  How do I see my RLTY Tokens in an ERC20 compatible wallet, like MyEtherWallet?  Add a custom token, and use the following info:  Contract Address: 0xbe99B09709fc753b09BCf557A992F6605D5997B0  Token Symbol: RLTY  Decimals: 8",False

If you post a question and don't get a response, it probably means we didn't see it. You can email us at info@smartrealty.io to ask your question or let us know that we missed your question (please include a link to your comment).    AIRDROP IS NOW CLOSED  Thanks to everyone who signed up for the airdrop. The response was overwhelming!  As mentioned on the airdrop sign up page, the airdrop of 99 RLTY is planned to be sent within 60 days after the ICO closes. Users must remain subscribed to our newsletter to receive airdrop.  Remember, submitting false information forfeits your right to airdrop tokens. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend participation at any time. We will be verifying all information submitted.    ICO IS ONGOING  The ICO is still ongoing so visit our main page to buy RLTY tokens today: www.smartrealty.io - There is a 40% bonus available for a limited time only. Any ETH sent to the Smart Contract ICO address will receive their tokens and bonus automatically. The ICO price is 0.0008 per RLTY token. That's 1250 RLTY tokens per 1 ETH contributed. However, with the 40% bonus that means a 1 ETH contribution will get you 1750 RLTY tokens.
