Here is the moment Neurocontrol Folks have been waiting for. Due to tons of ""NRG is SCAM"" attacks as blackmail attempts. Many people have the mistaken belief - Neurogress has nothing to support its claims, just a fiction, they said.   After weeks of brainstorming and discussions, our team decided to show to the World our brainchild - neurocontrol SOURCE CODE which is uploaded to GitHub.  https://github.com/Neurogress/GettingData  The Brain Waves Reading Module is the very first part of the Neurogress Living Creature we are going to share with the public. Put simply, NWR code is the code of the software which can read Brain Signals and lead those signals to the next part of the working system to transform thoughts into simple moves finally. This is Ground Zero of the complex called Neurocontrol.  Also, we want to start the particular format of videos and blogs names: ""NeuroContlol Customer Manual"" (NCCM)/ ""A Row Recruit Manual"". This video contains the fundamental steps in neurocontrol. The intention is to make you feel confident when you try it in real life, to make your first experience easygoing and enjoyable.

Many TGEs/ICOs have been targeted in the past by fraudsters stealing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars from unsuspecting TGE/ICO participants. Participants of the Neurogress Pre-TGE must follow the steps described below in order to avoid being scammed or otherwise bear the consequences of possible fraud. 1) Scammers often try to create fake ICO webpages that look like the official ones. So ALWAYS check that you are on the official Neurogress website: https://neurogress.io 2) You should NEVER hand over your private key. If someone claims to be someone from the Neurogress team and asks you for your private key, that's not us. We will NEVER ask you for your password, seed phrase or private key. 3) Don't believe anyone if they tell you that there is some Chinese or Russian Telegram chat, Facebook group, Twitter, etc. All our official SM platforms and chats are listed on the official Neurogress website. 4) Always check the address you transfer your BTC or ETH to. There is a highly sophisticated malware that changes the address. If it detects you have copied a coin address, the virus will change the address on your clipboard so that when you paste it, you are actually pasting the scammer’s address. 5) Precautionary measures are not limited to the steps described herein. If you notice anything suspicious we haven't included, you should always ask us in our Telegram chat here: https://t.me/Neurogress. Our team is here. We would be glad to answer any questions you may have.  ⚠️Neurogress team will not compensate any losses or damages that may occur as a result of neglecting the steps mentioned above.⚠️",False

I'm a CTO from Neurogress. Thank you for your question. It's always nice to experiment with neurointerfaces just to play with signals, however it's a complete different story when you need to build the whole AI-based ecosystem learning from those signals using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Add to that the need to provide people with the ability to transfer their brain activity to be accounted in the mainnet when the data goes into the distributed data base. The AI infrastructure, the blockchain infrastructure, the people developing the architecture and bridging things together from the software and hardware point of view. Then there's a marketplace for software, hardware, algorithm training etc. Plus the neurocontrol development, that's why we are all here for, right? I mean we are building the whole new industry of neurocontrol and putting one of its major elements on a blockchain. If that doesn't cost then what does? We believe that the money we collect won't be enough for all of the R&D we are planning to do along our jorney. But we will try our best. Stay tuned for more updates on our developments and please read the WP and go through the website to understand the scale of the work we are doing.",False

Muse and the neurointerfaces in general made it possible to capture the brain activity, however they are not robust enough to give you the real control of complex systems. There is an abundance of neural interfaces in the present market, but all of these currently available devices can only read basic brain signals. What they're not capable of, is a high level of specificity in reading and responding to brain commands. And that’s where Neurogress steps in to provide the essential means for neurocontrol. Once again, we do not develop neurointerfaces. Also, neurointerfaces by themselves can't control a single device. You are right that you can meditate with them, but what we use them for is to capture the brain activity or EEG, based on which those signals are injected into our AI-based software that translates signals into actions.  Again, we are not going to open our research now. We worked on it for 5 years and there is a lot of competition in the field. Someone can take advantage of it.

But after looking at their website and YouTube, I now understand this amazing project. First off, unlike SO many other projects out there, this team actually has a prototype! The ability to control things with out thoughts seems very far fetched, but Neurogree has got it. The platform that they've created is not only for them to use, but is the building block for other projects to use. This is one of the main reasons that they differ from their competitors. I also like how costs will be development. One of my concern is that the CEO doesn't seem to have really any experience in running a tech/science business. Nonetheless, I believe that this a project investing in!  Thank you for your valuable input.

The price of the token is determined by the needs for the project realization, by its total supply and its TGE stage (Pre-TGE - 50% bonus and TGE - 0-20%). You can also read in detail about the TGE structure in the white paper in section 5.1.    What is the probability that the number of tokens will increase for sale? If there are a lot of investors.  No, the amount is fixed. No more tokens will be issued.   Correctly I understand, if tokens will not be sold, they will lose value? Everywhere there is a risk .. something is not permanent.  The token which will not be sold will be burned, so yes they will lose value (only the tokens that were not sold). But that means that the sold tokens will have even more value due to the scarcity of supply.  And by the ICO terms the company has the opportunity to reduce or vice versa - to extend the time?  No, ICO will end when hard cap is reached. Every round, there is a fixed amount of tokens. If they are sold out, the round is closed. You can read about TGE structure in the white paper in section 5.  Quote from: AndrewAitken on January 26, 2018, 08:06:22 AM I think that project can helps many people around the world!

I hope you creat as soon as possible.  By the way,  I want to ask you about the price of TGE phase, for me as new investor  I think the price is so high,  but if we see the project,  it's normal price. So I want to know  How about your marketing promotion for reach the soft cap and the hard cap?  Do you believe with your bounty program it will make your reach your target?? I sure want to be investor in this project,  because I am very interested  The price is determined by the needs for the project realization and also by and the total supply (only 50M tokens for sale). You can check allocation of funds in our white paper section 5.1. As for the bounty, we don't have access to that account due to the mistake of one of our employees. We will create a new thread soon.

The same thread was created from the official Neurogress account. This is a new official announcement thread of Neurogress. The original one was deleted due to a mistake of one of our team member. Sorry for any inconveniences being caused.  Best regards, Neurogress team.  _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________  INTRODUCTION  Neurogress develops software for neurocontrolling electronics and machinery.  What is neurocontrol?  This is a technologically facilitated process which allows a person to directly manipulate a device using brain waves. Until recently, the ability to control objects using the power of thought was limited to the shape of our body. This is no longer true. A neurocontrol device gives humans the ability to control the world directly using thought. Our thoughts are ready to be translated to action.  https://i.imgur.com/eSRnsSR.jpg  _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________  With the development of technologies, it is now getting more and more possible to turn all our thoughts into actions outside of our body with the help of neural interface and AI injected software forming a neural control of the world around you.  THE PROBLEM  THE WEAKNESS OF NEURAL INTERFACES  One of the key goals of humankind is to be able to control the world around him/her. We control the world around us using our brain and body. When it is impossible - we use pseudointerfaces such as keyboards, gamepads, control pads, touch screens and other physical interfaces.  Until recently, the capabilities of controlling things with our brain were restricted by the shape of our body. The development of neural interfaces made it possible do get rid of barriers between your mind and device control, but they are still not ready to give you the real control of complex systems: robotics, smart home systems, software etc.  There is an abundance of neural interfaces in the present market, but all of these currently available devices can only read basic brain signals. What they're not capable of, is a high level of specificity in reading and responding to brain commands.  There are several immediate areas where neural control is essential: medicine, robotics, gaming, transportation, construction, IoT.  _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________  THE SOLUTION  A PLATFORM OF AI DRIVEN NEURAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Neurogress team develops a decentralized platform of neural control systems, based on the AI driven software and user-driven algorithm training.  We're going to make the control of electronics, software and hardware as easy and natural as never before.  Our mission is to build a smart environment based on neurocontrol, that will support different types of neurointerfaces and that is capable of being integrated into different kinds of products.  This goal can be achieved using a complex approach with a decentralised Ecosystem, which includes the following components:  https://i.imgur.com/DGjhFvz.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/sDVijJu.jpg  _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________  KEY FACTORS  The created ecosystem will help improve neurocontrol of other gadgets, including household appliances and entire standalone systems such as drones, robots, augmented reality devices and other mechatronic devices.  https://i.imgur.com/iUYuDuC.jpg  _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________  NEUROGRESS AI INTEGRATION IN NEUROCONTROL SYSTEMS  Our main product - AI-based neurocontrol software and the ecosystem we are building around it. We are not limited by the shape of our body anymore. We are linking our biological thoughts with electronics and machinery in the world around us.  Neurocontrol System is an end user product that enables neurocontrol operator to manipulate various devices using Neurogress software.  https://i.imgur.com/z3H6x6t.jpg  _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________  ALLOCATION OF COSTS  https://i.imgur.com/meY6MYM.jpg  _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________  NRG TOKEN ALLOCATION  https://i.imgur.com/bgTBdXP.jpg  Symbol: NRG; Amount for sale: 50 Million; Type: ERC20; Token price: 0.0014318 ETH; Exchanges: NRG will be tradable on exchanges; Accepted currencies: ETH & BTC.

Blockchain will bring several benefits to the project. Blockchain will ensure safe payments and a guarantee of full user compliance with use agreements. Blockchain effectively addresses the problem of data storage security and privacy. Blockchain is a decentralized system that is resistant to hacking attacks. Smart contracts for neurocommands also address any security concerns relating to the execution device. You can read about it more in detail in the White paper p. 10-12.
