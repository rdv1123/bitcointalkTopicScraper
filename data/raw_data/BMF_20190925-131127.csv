You so unorganised you don't even find out about KYC before you run your ICO you only find out about KYC afterwards so you can extract free work and hold our payment as randsom and threaten us by not paying unless we do what you  want.  You and your team shouldn't even be looking at KYC it is not your job. There are official KYC websites that handle and protect your data. BMF has no business in looking at our KYC and is not even supposed to be doing so. Perhaps you should look at what laws you should be following. If anyone should follow laws it is the people who run the ICO. Yo uasking us for money not the other way around. We need to know who you are.  You stole $400 from me. You have upset almost all the bounty hunters who worked for you. If we never worked for you and promoted you then noone would even know about BMF. You treat people like shit. We work months and then you don't even pay us.  BMF is very unorganised how are you going to run a farm when you can't even get the KYC right.  ASK FOR KYC BEFORE WE WORK NOT AFTER !!!! YOU ONLY ASKED AFTER BECAUSE YOU KNEW MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT WORK FOR YOU IF YOU ASKED FOR KYC SO YOU WERE DECIETFUL.  Why should anyone trust a company that hides certain crustial requirements? Just because where you live is fucked up doesn't mean the rest of the world are insane and think everyone is laundering money or is a terrorist. Those are your laws not mine. I do not need to give you my KYC by law.  KYC is ment to be checked by officials not some random internet clown.  I can also run an ico and ask for KYC. Who am I to look at others KYC?? I am not quilified and neither are you. KYC is supposed to be run from a thord party so that noone sees the info apart from the thirtd party which will be one person and a computer check that needs to be done only once. YOU ONLY NEED TO DO KYC ONCE FORVER!!! USE PROPER KYC CHANNELS YOU SHMUCKS  Now that you have pissed off half you investors what do you plan on doing next???

Our assumptions on capital expenditure to supply mining equipment, required infrastructure and electricity may be subject to changes, but have been vetted by our team. Project success will vary with Bitcoin Price, given the nature of our operations. The chart below gives you the return of each BMF after one year of operation, depending on BTC Price. E.g., if after one year from the End of ICO BTC Price is $14,000, we expect a BMF yearly return of 191%, i.e. BMF will be priced at least 1.91$. In the following table we computed the yearly payout for a Mining Contract (i.e. BMF) worth 100 at year zero, depending on BTC Price. A Yearly Performance Loss of 20% was assumed. E.g., if BTC Price will stabilise at $14.000 over the next 3 years, $100 spent on BMF Mining Contracts will be worth $455,32 in three years’ time",False

They wouldn't do it if that was the case. In the long run using green energy should pay itself off over 5-10 years and from then onwards you won't be paying for electricity. Keep in mind even if you don't use green energy you would use the same amount within 10 years or so. Definitly long term.

We first believed in professional mining and invested heavily to build our Mining Farm and develop new processes and know-how specific to mining management. If you are interested in developing your Mining Farm in your premises, together with our group we can follow you step by step, from the industrial and financial planning, up to the turnkey realization of your new Mining Factory. We are the first Italian company committed to creating a Miner Farm on our territory and with a development program of over 250 Bitminers already launched in early 2017 and with a forecast of mining power of over 10Gh for Ethereum, we are in fact the most important Miner Farm present in Italy.    After launching their Presale on July 1st, 2018 which ends July 20th, 2018, Bitminer Factory today announced their ICO will start July 21st, 2018 with limited time 12% discount. Their startup makes the Blockchain sustainable by using renewable energy to mine cryptocurrencies and shares the benefits with token holders. Crypto fans, Miners, and other investors will profit from the exponentially growing demand for energy to power worldwide crypto-mining activities.  Presale ends – 20/7/18 ICO starts – 21/7/18 Tokens to sell – 100,000,000 Presale (currently active) Dates – 01/7/18 to 20/7/18 Discount – 18% to 20/7/18 Lockup – 3 months Token price – $1.00 USD ICO Duration – 72 days (21/7/18 to 30/9/18) Discount tier 1  – 12% to 20/8/18 Discount tier 2  – 6% to 20/9/18 Token price – $1.00 USD Soft cap – $0.5M USD Hard cap – $100M USD  Energy needs for the global crypto-mining industry have increased fivefold in less than a year and are expected to double over the coming year. Bitminer Factory investors will profit by taking part in the radical transformation underway in the energy sector, switching from fossil-based to zero-carbon.  Gabriele Angeli said, “Our tokens represent a mining contract that allows anyone to benefit from the production of our mining and renewable energy plants.” Further, he added “We’re so confident we’ll succeed, we’re offering a Buy-Back plan for our tokens every three months where investors can sell back their tokens at an increasingly higher price.”  Bitminer is a startup from Angeli’s Group, constructors and energy producers for 40 years. With more than 20 collaborators and more than €3M revenues, they are the largest industrial crypto-mining group in Italy. Gabriele Angeli, Founder, has longstanding experience as a general contractor in the Oil and Gas and renewable energy industry, where his family business, Angeli Group has been working for large corporates worldwide for over 50 years.  Co-founder Gabriele Stampa brings extensive web project and web marketing expertise. In addition, Bitminer’s team of 20 collaborators bring a wealth of experience in Venture Capital, E-business, Finance, Hi-tech, Renewable energy, IoT and web development.  Together they have turned Bitminer Factory into the largest mining operator in Italy with over 18 months of hands-on business experience selling and operating Miners for both private and business clients.  About why Bitminer is offering an ICO, Gabriele added, “We decided to go to the next step and allow everyone to participate in our project by purchasing tokens. We want to make the Blockchain sustainable by using renewable energy to mine cryptocurrencies and share the benefits with our token holders.”   Roadmap  April 2017 Bitminer Factory implemented its first mining unit for Clients in our Mining Farm in Calenzano (Firenze, Italy).

Bitminer Factory is quite a large company that stretches across three European countries: Switzerland (expertise in financial services, regulatory aspects of work), Italy and Bosnia (the largest operator of mining farms in these countries with more than 1,000 mine workings). The company has its start in 2016 and during this time it is only expanding its borders, replenishing its staff with high-quality specialists and implementing innovative solutions in its work. The main mining facilities located in Bosnia allow the use of cheap electricity for the production of crypto currency (0.05 € / kWh), which significantly reduces costs. In addition, they use electricity, which remains unclaimed, which positively affects the entire energy complex. To date, the company conducts its own ICO, which is conducted with the aim of attracting additional investments in the company with a view to expanding it. By reaching 30% of the planned Hard Cap, namely the amount exceeding $ 20 million, the company will begin construction of solar and hydroelectric power stations, as the company uses 100% of clean renewable energy as a priority, besides, surplus electricity will be realized, giving additional profit to investors .
