First third of the video is mostly in general about AdHive and already completed milestones. Kurmet (Lead of Analytics department) talks about the completed campaigns on the platform and the process on how the platform itself works. He also talked briefly about the plans of enabling the support of Twitter native advertisement on the platform.  The completed campaigns in question are for example the one in progress right now about the advertisement of the new single from the artist's album. The task is for Instagram bloggers and they need to make and IG story with the single playing in the background. This way the single will become much more viral with the help of native advertisement.  The interviewer also asked why the platform uses AI and Blockchain technology, but this information you can see in our Whitepaper on AdHive.tv website. Check it out if you haven't seen it already!  The middle of the video focuses on discussion about competitors and native advertisement market as a whole. This information also can be found on the adhive.tv website in the Market Research, and the competitor comparison matrix can be found on page 56 in our Whitepaper here: https://adhive.tv/docs/AdHive_Whitepaper.pdf?v=1  And the last part of the video focuses on the new AI department which will focus exclusively on the outsourcing the AI solutions to businesses, here's the articles on this matter: https://medium.com/adhive/adhive-ai-department-c35ce4120c21 https://medium.com/adhive/ai-department-update-traintool-release-2-0-4c26780b2deb  There is also some talk about the advisers and their role in the project.

The digital advertising industry has surged by 23 percent over the first nine months of 2017, and its worth reached 116 billion rubles (almost $2 billion) according to the Association of Communication Agencies of Russia (ACAR). And according to Zenith Media, MAGNA Global and the Dentsu Aegis Network, Russia is the second advertising market in the world in terms of growth (9.8% annual) after India.  AdHive has chosen Russia to be its second major region of operations.  Problem solving Due to the overall distrustful attitude of advertisers towards small bloggers with modest numbers of followers/subscribers, paired by high transaction costs (such as search and negotiations), such bloggers have to advertise unscrupulous businesses, such as internet casinos and ponzi schemes, overpriced, low-quality chinese goods etc. In turn, the advertisers narrow down their potential reach by neglecting micro-influencers.  AdHive will help to change this situation for the better by giving advertisers a credible tool to launch their campaigns with hundreds of small bloggers, creating perfect opportunity for micro-influencers to get in touch with trusted brands and monetize their blogs without any harm to their reputation.  First campaigns AdHive has already successfully launched a few influencer marketing campaigns for Russian companies, such as SWITIPS, a popular cashback service, Druzhustelom (FriendsWithMyBody), a company founded by Rita Dakota, a well-known Russian pop singer, as well as several newspapers, such as spbvedomosti.ru. Dozens of Russian-speaking bloggers were involved in the SWITIPS campaign as their posts covered more than 500,000 users and aggregated more than 100,000 “Likes”.  Our goals As a part of our promotion strategy, we are going to take part and present our Platform to wide audiences in a number of meetings and social media oriented events, including Vidfest (video festival) and Neforum, the most popular events among Russian bloggers.  By the end of 2018, AdHive aims to attract up to 100,000 Russian influencers to the Platform. https://medium.com/adhive/adhive-invades-russia-3d2454278b2c",False

The digital advertising industry has surged by 23 percent over the first nine months of 2017, and its worth reached 116 billion rubles (almost $2 billion) according to the Association of Communication Agencies of Russia (ACAR). And according to Zenith Media, MAGNA Global and the Dentsu Aegis Network, Russia is the second advertising market in the world in terms of growth (9.8% annual) after India.  AdHive has chosen Russia to be its second major region of operations.  Problem solving Due to the overall distrustful attitude of advertisers towards small bloggers with modest numbers of followers/subscribers, paired by high transaction costs (such as search and negotiations), such bloggers have to advertise unscrupulous businesses, such as internet casinos and ponzi schemes, overpriced, low-quality chinese goods etc. In turn, the advertisers narrow down their potential reach by neglecting micro-influencers.  AdHive will help to change this situation for the better by giving advertisers a credible tool to launch their campaigns with hundreds of small bloggers, creating perfect opportunity for micro-influencers to get in touch with trusted brands and monetize their blogs without any harm to their reputation.  First campaigns AdHive has already successfully launched a few influencer marketing campaigns for Russian companies, such as SWITIPS, a popular cashback service, Druzhustelom (FriendsWithMyBody), a company founded by Rita Dakota, a well-known Russian pop singer, as well as several newspapers, such as spbvedomosti.ru. Dozens of Russian-speaking bloggers were involved in the SWITIPS campaign as their posts covered more than 500,000 users and aggregated more than 100,000 “Likes”.  Our goals As a part of our promotion strategy, we are going to take part and present our Platform to wide audiences in a number of meetings and social media oriented events, including Vidfest (video festival) and Neforum, the most popular events among Russian bloggers.

AdHive will help to change this situation for the better by giving advertisers a credible tool to launch their campaigns with hundreds of small bloggers, creating perfect opportunity for micro-influencers to get in touch with trusted brands and monetize their blogs without any harm to their reputation.  First campaigns AdHive has already successfully launched a few influencer marketing campaigns for Russian companies, such as SWITIPS, a popular cashback service, Druzhustelom (FriendsWithMyBody), a company founded by Rita Dakota, a well-known Russian pop singer, as well as several newspapers, such as spbvedomosti.ru. Dozens of Russian-speaking bloggers were involved in the SWITIPS campaign as their posts covered more than 500,000 users and aggregated more than 100,000 “Likes”.  Our goals As a part of our promotion strategy, we are going to take part and present our Platform to wide audiences in a number of meetings and social media oriented events, including Vidfest (video festival) and Neforum, the most popular events among Russian bloggers.  By the end of 2018, AdHive aims to attract up to 100,000 Russian influencers to the Platform. https://medium.com/adhive/adhive-invades-russia-3d2454278b2c",False

Putting it simple AdHive was created to implement their video and speech recognition modules the best way possible.  In Q3 of 2017 the whole concept of the Influencer Marketing Platform was developed and the Token Sale dates were announced. Dmitry Malyanov accompanied by a few team members started the AdHive road show to share ideas about the future of advertising and introduce the concept of the first AI-driven blockchain platform for easy placement of native ads through bloggers.  While Dmitry was sharing his vision and promoting the Platform, our development team was working around the clock to release the early version of the platform as soon as it was possible. And they succeeded as the Alpha was introduced on 27th of December. The platform was far from being ideal, but it already represented the founders’ vision and interested many progressive people in the project. Such professionals as Serguei Popov, Soheil Mirpour, Chad Politt and others joined our advisory board.  The Token Presale was launched on January 30. It was a surprise for us to see such a huge amount of interested and inspired people, we saw lots of registrations, not only whitelist applications, but influencers who already wished to try out the Platform. As a result the presale was closed in under 36 minutes! It was a real fuss!  To organize the Token Sale in the smoothest and safest possible way Alexander Kuzmin developed a special Deposit system for Whitelist members. They were able to deposit their Ethereum, that was automatically converted into ADH Tokens in the Personal Account right after the Token Sale start. As a result the hardcap was reached by 28th of February with deposits only!  In March 2018, a few weeks after the Token Sale ended, AdHive released the advertiser’s account on the Platform Alpha, hundreds of influencers have been joining our community every week ever since.  On 12th of April the Tokens were distributed and ADH was listed on Qryptos, one of the most promising exchanges, followed up with HitBTC listing just a week later.  In the end of April AdHive released the Beta version of the Platform, but what is more important — the first advertising campaigns were successfully launched and advertisers achieved desired results and AdHive received first revenues!  In early May we officially announced our Indonesian expansion, as well as opening our office in Jakarta! The high level of social media activity and rapid growth of digital marketing made Indonesia a perfect match for AdHive.  https://medium.com/adhive/adhive-road-so-far-6eeb7067ca95",False

The AdHive platform buys the views from influencers with discount, influencers gain access to mass advertising campaigns, and advertisers get an integrated media channel for targeted message delivery and analysis of video content for brands and keyword mentions. It’s similar to contextual advertising, but in video format. The platform margin is generated from the gap between bid and offer prices and should always remain sufficient because small influencers are happier to work for lower rewards, and in addition, advertisers are happier to avoid collaboration with large groups of influencers. Influencers will sell their contacts with their audience through wholesale prices, for access to large campaigns. The margin of each placement can differ depending on the goal of the placement — either to grow the margins, or to grow the involvement of rating influencers. For example, each 1000 views (CPM) costs 20 ADH Tokens for the advertiser, while the influencer gets 14 ADH for each 1000 views, 1 ADH per each 1000 views transfers to the community for assessment, 5 ADH is retained by the platform.",False

Google (with video pre-rolls) provides an opportunity to deliver commercials to spectators similar to TV ad breaks. Such commercials are not related to the content, as there is almost no engagement of the audience. The price of such placement is based on number of views and additionally depends on current demand from other advertisers, and would not be less than the cost of a campaign on AdHive. Nevertheless, demand could affect the pricing on AdHive. The cost of placement with influencers is more inert, stable and predictable, and more sensitive to ad tasks than to demand. Google might be the better option for the promotion of difficult products or something people do not want to be connected with, but for the promotion of simple, attractive, or common products and services, AdHive will perform better. Google may be more convenient and familiar, and in some cases it may be better to use both AdHive and Google, but AdHive will ultimately be easier as it removes the necessity of actually producing commercials, and is more cost-effective since there will be a much higher engagement rate. In addition, it will be transparent, with smart contracts. And that is not even mentioning the curiosity factor — people will generate a lot of new unique content. We will provide a high level of comfort and confidentiality through native video ad placement with influencers. By giving Google the right to show pre-rolls before videos, influencers can get an average of $0,7 per 1000 views of video, but influencers can earn up to $4 (6 times) from AdHive for native ads which is much more engaging for the audience. Plus, influencers can avoid irritating viewers with pre-rolls and get feedback and knowledge from the AdHive community on how to improve video quality and video ad placement. AdHive requires more involvement from influencers and most likely increases the time for video creation but the reward is significant.",False

And here’re only some reasons why: 1. QRYPTOS is a licensed crypto exchange, which operates under the supervision of the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA). The JFSA is the official regulator of the country’s financial sector.  2. All traders’ funds are stored on cold wallets ONLY . Each application for withdrawal is processed manually by an exchange cooperator, which significantly reduces the risk of any fraud.  3. The Exchange does not charge a commission for deposits and withdrawals of cryptocurrencies, which helps a trader to reduce transfer costs.  4. Low commissions for transactions (for all crypto pairs, the Maker receives a 0.075% rebate, the Taker pays 0.15%). This is one of the few exchanges that rewards Makers.  5. A comprehensive platform interface for professional trading with convenient integration of the company’s official Telegram channel for prompt solution to traders’ problems.",False

QRYPTOS is a licensed crypto exchange, which operates under the supervision of the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA). The JFSA is the official regulator of the country’s financial sector. 2. All traders’ funds are stored on cold wallets ONLY . Each application for withdrawal is processed manually by an exchange cooperator, which significantly reduces the risk of any fraud. 3. The Exchange does not charge a commission for deposits and withdrawals of cryptocurrencies, which helps a trader to reduce transfer costs. 4. Low commissions for transactions (for all crypto pairs, the Maker receives a 0.075% rebate, the Taker pays 0.15%). This is one of the few exchanges that rewards Makers. 5. A comprehensive platform interface for professional trading with convenient integration of the company’s official Telegram channel for prompt solution to traders’ problems.",False

One of the features of the platform is complex and reliable assessment of native video ad placement efficiency by community members, making advertising measurable and understandable with proven results.

Community members balance the interests of influencers and advertisers. The platform shares advertisement budgets among the all Platform participants to maximize motivation to act and develop the platform ecosystem. AdHive will be built as an environment where each participant will be motivated to act and develop the platform ecosystem, which will in turn increase rewards for all participants involved. Financial mechanics for each part is based on a profit-and-loss approach where influencers must need to guarantee their intentions via a security deposit of ADH Tokens, which will be locked in a smart contract until certain conditions are met. Community members risk missing out on rewards in case of incorrect assessments of ad quality. Rewards for community members depend on the amount of Tokens held in their wallets. This approach will motivate influencers to place ads properly and community members to make more accurate assessments and well-informed surveys. It also provides anti-spam and Sybil-attack protection",False

Payments for campaign can be done via cryptocurrencies or via project Tokens which will be converted to AdHive Tokens. An advertiser can select the target audience by all available parameters (with API), place the advertising task, create triggers and request explanations of recognition modules, and credit the deposit by any type of money (fiat or crypto currencies). After the campaign opens, it must be approved by an AdHive moderator. During the campaign real time data is collected on the dashboard with the appropriate metrics. During the period of adoption of the AdHive platform and AI technology there will be no cost for explanations of AI video and speech recognition modules.  The Platform is designed to work with influencers and streamers in the same way — by “influencers” we mean video bloggers on Youtube, Instagram etc., as opposed to streamers from Twitch, Smashcast etc. Video recognition modules for streams are included in the release of v.07 and will be deployed in 2018. The process and approach for streamers will be identical to that of influencers with a small difference in reward calculation. Moreover, influencers on Instagram can stream their video, so the difference between influencer and streamer is not so significant now and will disappear almost entirely soon. All functionality for influencers will be available from the client cabinet with notifications by any channel selected or chosen- email, SMS, messengers and app notifications. The wallet will provide the mechanics for convenient spending or saving of the Tokens.  More information you can find in White Paper P25 - https://adhive.tv/docs/AdHive_Whitepaper.pdf",False

WINGS — Decentralized platform for crowdfunding projects. Wings plays a significant role in tech support for the AdHive crowd-sale campaign. The Wings community brings marketing support for the project.  AdEx is a blockchain-based ad exchange aimed at disrupting the existing online advertising landscape and addressing its significant problems: advertising fraud, privacy, and consent to receiving sponsored messages, etc. The partnership between AdEx and AdHive will allow us to function more effectively in the advertising market for both projects. In particular, some AdEx advertising campaigns related to video will be implemented on the AdHive platform using ADH Tokens.  The Bancor protocol enables built-in price discovery and a liquidity mechanism for Tokens on smart contract blockchains. The Bancor protocol eliminates the liquidity risk for ADH Token holders by providing exchange mechanisms for ADH Tokens through the Token Changer — a combination of an exchange and market-maker based on smart contracts. The Token Changer is a smart Token that holds two or more digital assets in its reserve and is used to exchange between ADH Tokens, BNT Tokens, ETH, etc.",False

So, for the majority of the ones that had no opportunity to purchase ADH during the Presale, the situation is identical - their ETH funds drop in price. Those are the usual risks for crypto.   Our community was informed about the pricing policy during the Presale and Phase 1 stages – price is fixed and tied to ETH, official conversion rate remains the same for both of the stages: 1 ETH = 5000 ADH and only bonuses are different. It’s a symmetrical market risk – the project was also funded in ETH, so the amount of funds we've got still decreases as the ETH goes down. Basic risks of the market affect all of us.  And do not forget that most community members keep money on ETH, not USD. I think it should be clear.",False

We already talked in telegram!  There are a lot of people in the TG group, there have been even more whitelisted participants, which are not in the TG group. So what exactly seems unbelieveble to you in the number ""6k"" participants. I would understand if you didn't believe the ""300k bloggers"" remark, but that was mainly the disinformation on your behalf, because none of our official media sources mention this number.  The Q&A in Telegram allows for participation and inclusion of the maximum amount of people. Not everyone is available to use stream. Also, when there is 3 co-founders, the stream option becomes unoptimal, they can't talk over each other, so the speed of answering the questions becomes much lower. This wastes everyone's time.  Really, you think the team doesn't have enough expertise? Have you read about the AI behind the platform? It have been developed for a long time by 2 of the co-founders. Check it out, i think you will like it And ""Alpha"" version explains a lot. Its the most barebones version available. Soon the Beta will be launched, you will be able to check it out for yourself, but even now the platform is able to recognise tagging.  There's no ""cleaning up"" the questions. Only obvious attempts at spreading FUD (for example ignoring concise answers and continuous provocation), spam, and negative attitude towards other members of community is deleted.  You might not believe the 5.5M in 36 minutes ""story"" but there is no actual reason for us to lie about that, and the community that participated in the pre-sale will tell you that this numbers are true, and the pre-sale really ended in such a short time. You can even use the search function in Telegram, and see the messages for 30 of January (When the pre-sale began)  Regarding the AI mechanics: please tell us what in the WP is unexplained or unbelievable about the AI functionality? Why it can't be implemented? Its not something out of this world. It WILL be able to be used to utilize our platform automation to the fullest extent.

So, for the majority of the ones that had no opportunity to purchase ADH during the Presale, the situation is identical - their ETH funds drop in price. Those are the usual risks for crypto. Our community was informed about the pricing policy during the Presale and Phase 1 stages – price is fixed and tied to ETH, official conversion rate remains the same for both of the stages: 1 ETH = 5000 ADH and only bonuses are different.  Token Presale and Token Sale Phase 1 buyers will get the same amount of tokens per 1 ETH, but the Presale buyers get a higher bonus. If ADH was tied to USD and then the price of ETH would have doubled after the presale, as it was expected by the majority of the community, then you would just complain that presale buyers received much less tokens (for each ETH) than the buyers of the Phase 1.  And do not forget that most community members keep money on ETH, not USD. I think it should be clear.",False

Let me dismiss some of your notions, if you let me  Have you read the mechanics of Token Sale phase 2 in the WP? Here's a short summary: 1. The second phase will be distributed over time, the tokens will be sold in batches within a few months, to the Phase 1 purchasers in prior with a 10% bonus on the market price but with the maximum limit on the purchase (in proportion to their first purchase). so there would be no sharp impact on the ADH's market price.  2. Participants of the presale and the first phase will apply for participation in the second phase to purchase ADH with additional 10% bonus, but the amount of their purchase will be limited by the volume of tokens purchased at the first stages + all tokens acquired during the second phase will be vested (without a direct affection on the market price), such a mechanics minimizes the impact, making a huge dump impossible.  So, as you can see the same amount of tokens that have been sold during pre-sale and token sale phase 1 will be sold at phase 2. The price will be market price at that moment. Why do that, you ask? Well, We clearly understand how much money is needed now to implement the project at the initial stage. And what's scammy in raising additional funds exactly when they will be needed? Its more honest and wiser to spend funds according to the current needs, instead of collecting everything at once, isn't it? And the cap is settled: $12 million for Token Sale Phase 1 which will begin on 21st of February!  Regarding the question about smartcontracts and issuing of tokens: ADH would be purchased via personal tokensale cabinets. Smart contract would be implemented for token distribution and vestings for private presale purchasers, founders, advisors,  network growth and tokensale phase 2 - as per our whitepaper. We're not an open source yet. Some of our technological methods seemed to be unique, but some of them would be published soon.

In our last medium article when the pre-sale ended: https://medium.com/adhive/adhive-presale-closed-with-5-5-million-in-36-minutes-75622b043862 we provided the statistics, and you can see the information ""Over 6K influencers registered on the AdHive Platform"" Nowhere near 300k, i think Also regarding the functionality comment. Right now the platform is in alpha stage, so give it a pass. We're rolling out the beta of the platform this month actually! And you are welcome to try it out when it becomes available! Stay tuned.  Also in the exact medium article there was information why the pre-sale hardcap was overreached. Due to large number of token purchasers, we’ve experienced a technical issue, the transactions data was sent with a delay. Thus hardcap limitation worked properly, but it was delayed.  What do you mean ""not confirmed advisors""?

Influencer marketing already has platforms that integrate brands and advertisers. But there are no platforms that are fully automated, as AdHive.

To reach the target audience of a brand, the project will need to attract more influencers with fewer subscribers.  ICORating is a rating agency that issues independent analytical research, evaluating ICO projects and assigning them ratings. At ICORating we aim to develop clear assessment standards for projects and assign ratings based on a transparent and standardized scale.  Within the framework of its work, ICO Rating carried out a full and multilayered analysis of the AdHive project. ICO Rating experts notice the AdHive project team appears highly qualified, demonstrates a deep knowledge of the market and understanding of its trends, and uses high-tech, proven solutions for the use of AI.  AdHive provides an alternative, high-tech method of interaction between advertisers and bloggers for the placement of native advertising, which is currently in demand and experiencing growth. Manual control is not possible here, so the process of confirming the fulfillment of tasks by bloggers will be automated by the AI technology.  There is a clear trend for increasing the share of native advertising in company budgets, which together with a growing global market for digital video advertising will help towards the success of the project.  AdHive’s entry into the market sets a high threshold for the competition as assessed by ICO Rating. The world class ICO rating agency claims that multiple combined factors are contributing to the high probability of the project conducting a successful ICO. The ICO Rating review has granted the AdHive project a ‘Stable Plus’ rating based on a multilayered scoring system.  ICO Rating grants evaluation levels of Positive+, Positive, Stable+, Stable, Risky+, Risky, Risky-, Negative, Negative-.

Our unit of service is a number of views that a blogger gets with a native ad. In order to participate in ad campaigns running over the AdHive platform, users are required to purchase and hold long-term ADH Tokens to be able to apply them to various advertising and quality assessments tasks. This mechanic should motivate all the participants to execute tasks properly. As the platform develops and the audience of users grows, demand for ADH Tokens will increase, but the total amount of Tokens never exceeds the number initially issued. The Platform also proposes a way of earning ADH Tokens as a reward for user endeavors. To provide platform operations, AdHive will make regular purchases of ADH Tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges. This model maintains high demand for ADH Tokens by platform users and by the AdHive platform itself, creating a direct relationship between the success of the project and the potential growth of the Token: the more users on the platform, the more Tokens are involved with internal payments, the greater the demand and liquidity of the Token on the cryptocurrency markets. In time, as ADH Token is utilized by more users and adopted by more project partners, it will bring significant growth and value to the AdHive ecosystem.",False

The ADH Token is a utility Token, all payments on theplatform will be made in ADH Tokens and users will be motivated to keep part of their ADH Tokens on the platform. The Company’s income will be stored in Tokens without conversion to fiat. For a long time, our costs will be covered by raised funds. The amount of long-term holders (bloggers,community, company) will constantly rise, while the offer is limited. The amount of mid-term holders (advertisers), for the time of the advertising campaign, will rise as well. That’s how the demand for the ADH Tokens will always be higher than the supply.",False

It has been just a few years since the cryptocurrency world discovered a modern way of crowdfunding. The method was named the ICO (initial coin offering). The first acknowledged ICO was conducted by the blockchain project Mastercoin in June, 2013.  Since then, the ICO industry has exploded on the cryptocurrency market, spawning an incredible number of disputes and discussions on the topic. We have heard many arguments from opponents and proponents of ICOs in the last four and a half years.  Some suggest that ICOs are the greatest financial bubble ever. Many support such a hypothesis based on the development of blockchain technology and the advent of smart contracts. Regardless of the theories, there is no doubts that the Token Sale has become the most efficient way of fundraising for ambitious tech start-ups.  AdHive aims to revolutionize the traditional advertising market via the implementation of a platform powered by AI and blockchain technology, easily connecting bloggers and advertisers, and providing high quality service and reliable results.  Being a blockchain-based platform, AdHive follows the Token Sale scenario for its crowdfunding process. The given method of raising funds necessary is a transparent and safe way for both parties — investors and the project team.  The Token Sale implies a well-defined plan of the project’s post-sale development, which guarantees the improved implementation of all goals identified within.  https://medium.com/adhive/adh-tokens-and-how-to-get-them-token-sale-and-referral-program-1779fa1b0746",False

The Advertiser can put links in the field for channels which should be excluded from the pool. 2. List of sponsored influencers — advertisers can send promo Tokens to groups of influencers manually mentioned (links to their channels) or  filtered by their rating, to motivate them to take part in the campaign. Such Tokens can only be received for execution of a particular advertising task. If the influencer does not execute the task, the promo Tokens will be returned to the advertiser.  Please, take into consideration that our main objective is to bring  advertised content to the targeted audience in a very native way by those who are popular within the mentioned targeted audience.",False
